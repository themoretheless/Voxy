# Scythe

Scythe is a lightweight, C#-based game engine focused on modifiability and rapid iteration using [Raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib).
<br/>
It combines a modern rendering pipeline, a fully integrated editor, and a runtime into a single codebase.

> [!NOTE]  
> Scythe is a hobby project. It is developed by me alone, for personal enjoyment. Do not expect official support, and relying on it for commercial projects is entirely your own responsibility and is not recommended.

> [!CAUTION]  
> Scythe is still in an early stage of development and is not even in an Alpha or Beta phase. Existing features may be removed or changed at any time. It is not unexpected for sample projects to be incomplete, for some existing features to be temporarily unavailable, or for default settings to change with each commit.

## 🎯 Who is this for?

- Indie developers who want full control over engine internals.
- Developers interested in moddable, scriptable game architectures.
- Learning-oriented projects *(rendering, physics, and engine tooling)*.
- Developers who prefer code-first workflows over black-box engines.

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

- Component-based object model *(not ECS)*.
- Shared runtime between editor and game execution.

## ✨ Features

### Core

- **Modern .NET:** High-performance architecture built on the latest .NET 10 runtime.
- **Hybrid Runtime/Editor:** Combines a scene editor with a fast game runtime in a single environment.
- **Asset Management:** Centralized asset manager with hot-reloading via filesystem watching.
    - **Models:** .fbx, .obj, .gltf
    - **Textures:** .png, .jpg, .jpeg, .tga, .bmp
    - **Shaders:** .vs, .fs

### Graphics

- **PBR Rendering:** Shader-based Physically Based Rendering *(PBR)* support for realistic material appearance.
- **Advanced Lighting & Shadows:** Dynamic light sources with real-time Shadow Mapping.
- **Transparent Render Queue:** Proper depth-sorted rendering of transparent objects.
- **Skybox:** Skybox rendering with cubemaps.
- **Post-Processing:**
    - SSAO *(Screen Space Ambient Occlusion)*
    - FXAA, SMAA, TAA *(with jitter)*
    - Bloom, Blur, Pixellizer, Cross Hatching, Cross Stitching, Sobel edge detection, Scanlines, Fisheye, Dream Vision, Predator, Grayscale, Posterization

### Animation
- **Skeletal Animation:** Mesh skinning and bone animation.
- **Animation Blending:** Smooth transitions between animations.

### Physics

- **Pure C# Physics:** Jitter2 integration written entirely in C#.
- Support for dynamic and static objects.

### Editor

- **Docking UI:** ImGui-based interface with freely dockable windows.
- **Level Browser:** Hierarchical object management with a layered structure.
- **Object Browser:** Real-time panel for editing object properties.
- **Undo / Redo System:** Action history tracking across editor operations.
- A built-in music player! 😎

### Scripting

- **C# Scripting:** Write game logic in high-performance C# with full access to engine components.
  - High-performance C# script execution.
  - Automatic script compilation.
- **Dynamic Input:** Simple management of mouse and keyboard input for both the editor and scripting layers.

## ❌ What this is not

- Not a full-scale AA/AAA engine.
- Not an ECS-first architecture.
- Not focused on visual scripting.

## 👷 Building

> [!NOTE]

git clone https://github.com/fkerimk/scythe.git
cd scythe
dotnet build
```

## 🏹 Running

```ps
dotnet run
```

- Opens the project launcher
- Open/Create a project
- Press F5 to enter play mode
