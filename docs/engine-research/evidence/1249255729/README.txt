## Project Purpose

Asset Injector is built around one practical goal: transplant original EQOA Vanilla character geometry into *EverQuest Online Adventures: Frontiers* without breaking the PS2 engine assumptions around skeleton memory, DMA packet layout, material state, or CDVD file loading.

The project is intentionally technical, but the motivation is human: keeping an older online world understandable, inspectable, and repairable instead of letting its formats and tooling disappear into scattered notes and one-off scripts.

| Area | Role |
| --- | --- |
| Main author | Ahmad Hassan (B-Ted) |
| Target platform | PlayStation 2 / PCSX2 |
| Main language | Python 3.12 |
| Primary task | Geometry-only macro-node transplant |
| Utility base | EQOA community tools organized under `UTILITIES/` |
| Output | Bootable patched Frontiers ISO |

---

## Status

| Capability | State | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Invisible character fix | Solved | Preserves Frontiers render-critical material state. |
| `0x0` TLB miss crash | Solved | Avoids EE skeleton buffer overflow. |
| DMA/VIF integrity | Solved | Moves whole geometry macro-nodes instead of splicing float arrays. |
| In-place ISO patching | Implemented | Avoids rebuilding layouts that break PS2 CDVD expectations. |
| Documentation | Active | Architecture and workflow notes are being consolidated. |

---

## Architecture Overview

The pipeline is deliberately conservative. It keeps the Frontiers runtime container intact and replaces only the geometry macro-node that carries the Vanilla mesh payload.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Vanilla assets\nCHAR.ESF / CSF] --> B[Parse asset databases]
    C[Frontiers assets\nCHAR.ESF / CSF] --> B
    B --> D[Identify matching target records]
    D --> E[Extract Frontiers model wrapper]
    D --> F[Extract Vanilla geometry macro-node]
    E --> G[Preserve runtime-safe Frontiers nodes]
    F --> H[Validate DMA and VIF payloads]

    H --> I
    I --> J[Rebuild CHAR.ESF payload]
    J --> K[Patch ISO in place]
    K --> L[Bootable patched Frontiers ISO]
```

### Core Design Rule

> Preserve the structures the Frontiers engine allocates and schedules. Replace the geometry payload only after it can be moved as a whole, aligned object.

That rule is why the project avoids naive binary merging. The PS2 engine is sensitive to node order, buffer size expectations, DMA alignment, VIF packet layout, material state, and UDF/CDVD placement.

## Patch Lifecycle

| Phase | What Happens | Why It Exists |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Baseline preparation | Required Vanilla and Frontiers assets are placed in expected folders. | Keeps original and target data separated. |
| 2. Database parsing | ESF/CSF records and pointer tables are inspected. | Prevents guesswork around offsets and payload sizes. |
| 3. Structural comparison | Vanilla and Frontiers model trees are compared. | Identifies what can move and what must stay native. |
| 4. Macro-node graft | Vanilla `0x02610` geometry is inserted into a Frontiers-safe wrapper. | Preserves DMA chain integrity. |
| 5. Verification | DMA tags, materials, skeleton assumptions, and payload boundaries are audited. | Catches runtime-breaking mistakes before ISO patching. |
| 6. ISO patching | `CHAR.ESF` is patched directly into the original ISO layout. | Avoids CDVD/LBA breakage from full ISO rebuilds. |
| 7. Runtime testing | Patched output is tested in emulator. | Confirms the fix survives actual engine behavior. |

---

## Technical Problem

Early transplant attempts failed for four engine-level reasons:

| Problem | Cause | Resolution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| EE skeleton overflow | Vanilla models used a smaller skeleton than the Frontiers animation controller expected. | Preserve Frontiers skeleton and bone matrix allocation. |
| DMA tag misalignment | Splicing float arrays disturbed strict 16-byte packet boundaries. | Move the entire geometry macro-node instead of partial data. |
| ADC bit damage | Zeroing `W` destroyed the anti-double-clipping bit. | Preserve the original packed vertex payload. |
| Render rejection | Vanilla material nodes did not match Frontiers render expectations. | Preserve Frontiers material state. |

## Build & Deployment Pipeline

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    clone[Clone repository] --> setup[Run setup_environment.bat]
    setup --> assets[Place baseline ISOs]
    assets --> run[Run EQOA_MASTER_TOOL.bat]
    run --> patch[Patch Game ISO]
    patch --> verify[Run diagnostics / emulator checks]
    verify --> output[iso/patched]
```

### Quick Start

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Run `setup_environment.bat`.
3. Confirm the required baseline ISOs exist:
   - `iso/unpatched/EQOA_Original.iso`
   - `iso/unpatched/EQOA_Frontiers.iso`
4. Run `EQOA_MASTER_TOOL.bat`.
5. Choose `Patch Game ISO`.
6. Test the generated ISO from `iso/patched/`.

> Close the emulator before patching. Open file handles can cause `[Errno 13] Permission Denied` during ISO writes.

## Development Workflow

```mermaid
gitGraph
    commit id: "baseline research"
    branch diagnostics
    checkout diagnostics
    commit id: "trace RAM / offsets"
    commit id: "compare model trees"
    checkout main
    merge diagnostics
    branch transplant
    checkout transplant
    commit id: "geometry macro-node graft"
    commit id: "DMA validation"
    checkout main
    merge transplant
    commit id: "ISO patch output"
```

Recommended contribution path:

1. Start with a small, reproducible asset or diagnostic case.
2. Add evidence under `diagnostics/` or `docs/` before changing transplant behavior.
3. Keep binary patching changes isolated and explain offset assumptions.
4. Run the relevant verifier before trusting emulator output.
5. Document new findings where the next person will look first.

New people are welcomed, especially around documentation, reproducible diagnostics, safer validation, and clearer format notes.

## Notes

This repository does not distribute commercial game ISOs. Baseline ISO files are local inputs and are intentionally ignored by Git.

The project is technical preservation work. The code favors explicit binary evidence, repeatable diagnostics, and narrow changes over broad rewrites.
