## ⚡ Beyond the Standard

Pulsar Engine is built by developers who believe core engine tech should be more than just a collection of legacy features. We are rebuilding the foundation of world simulation with clarity and intent.

*   **Scalable World Simulation:** Advanced spatial partitioning for high-fidelity environments.
*   **Rust-First Tooling:** Leveraging modern memory safety and performance from the ground up.
*   **Explicit Architecture:** Modular design that favors maintainability over short-term hacks.
*   **In-Editor Stability:** prioritizing a reliable workspace for creators as a first-class citizen.

## ⚠️ Project Status

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> **Pulsar is in early-stage development.** You likely cannot build a full production game yet. The codebase is experimental, subject to heavy architectural shifts, and open to community contributions.

**Current Roadmap:** [View Projects & Milestones](https://github.com/orgs/Far-Beyond-Pulsar/projects/1)

## 🤝 Join the Movement

Development happens in the open. Whether you're a systems engineer or a technical artist, your input helps shape the engine.

*   💬 **[Discord](https://discord.gg/5eAKDC53SX):** Real-time dev updates and brainstorming.
*   🧠 **[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/Far-Beyond-Pulsar/Pulsar-Native/discussions):** Long-form design proposals.
*   ⭐ **Support:** Star, Watch, or Fork the repository to boost visibility.

## Instalaltion

- Download the appropriate binary for your machine from the `Releases` page.
- Ensure you have the rust language installed [How to install](https://rust-lang.org/tools/install/)
- Run the engine binary

## Source Build

The Pulsar-Native repo consists of many crates and git sub modules leading to a multi-step setup to build from source.

### Clone the repo

Cloning out repo gives you a full copy of the entire project hsitory locally right on your machine

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Far-Beyond-Pulsar/Pulsar-Native
```

### Pull the Submodules

Sub modules allow us to store code in other GitHub repos and reference them in the main repo helping to reduce repo bloat and enforce separation

```bash
git submodule update --init
```

### Install Deps (Linux)

On linux you may need to install some packages to allow the build to complete properly; here are the ones we needed on Ubuntu Desktop:

```bash
sudo apt update

sudo apt install -y \
  gcc g++ clang libfontconfig-dev libwayland-dev \
  libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev libxkbcommon-x11-dev libx11-xcb-dev \
  libssl-dev libzstd-dev \
  vulkan-validationlayers libvulkan1
```

### Build via Cargo

```bash
cargo build --release
```
