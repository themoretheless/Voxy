## Roadmap

For upcoming features and a general status of Saturn it is best to view the [Trello](https://trello.com/b/baqP3fvB/saturn-engine)

## Getting Started & Prerequisites

Before anything please make sure you have the [Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home) installed.
If you do not have the Vulkan SDK the project will **not** build.
Saturn uses vulkan version 1.2, however any newer version should "just work". When installing if there's an option about debug binaries make sure to tick that.

If you are on macOS or Linux you should check if your system has the .NET SDK installed, if you do not, you can download it from [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/10.0).

Now, start by cloning the repository with `git clone --recursive https://github.com/0xsmft/Saturn-Engine`.

If the repository was previously cloned non-recursively then use `git submodule update --init` to clone the necessary submodules.

Make sure to check that you are on the branch `vulkan`. If not you can run `git checkout vulkan`.

## Building
