# Balaur

**A 2D &amp; 3D node-based game engine, fully deterministic, with scripts that reload in milliseconds.**

Written in Rust. A game exports to a single executable.

## Features

- **Nodes and scenes** — a tree of named nodes with scripts attached; scenes are plain TOML.
- **Rune scripting** — Rust's syntax, async/await, a debugger in the editor.
- **Hot reload** — save a script while the game runs; live in milliseconds, state intact.
- **Determinism** — same inputs, same bits, every platform. Record a session and replay it.
- **Physics** — Rapier in 2D and 3D, stepped on a fixed tick, 60 Hz by default.
- **Rendering** — wgpu: windowed, offscreen for CI screenshots, or headless.
- **Animation** — clips, tweens and state machines, 2D bones with skinned polygons, glTF rigs, IK.
- **Editor** — itself a Balaur project: scene tree, inspector, gizmos, timeline, play-in-editor.
- **Networking** — HTTP, WebSocket and WebTransport, recorded with the session for replay.
- **Platforms** — Windows, macOS, Linux; iOS, Android and web cross-compiled in CI on every push.
- **Export** — one self-contained binary per target: bytecode, scenes and assets fused onto the runtime.

## Prerequisites

[rustup](https://rustup.rs) (`rust-toolchain.toml` pins the version), a C and C++ compiler, and on Linux:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential pkg-config libasound2-dev libudev-dev \
  libx11-dev libxcursor-dev libxrandr-dev libxi-dev libxkbcommon-dev libwayland-dev
```

Other platforms and distros: [Build from source](https://balaurengine.org/docs/building).

## Quickstart

```bash
cargo run -p balaur_cli -- new my-game
cargo run -p balaur_cli -- run my-game                        # dev mode, hot reload on
cargo run -p balaur_cli --features window -- edit my-game     # open in the editor
cargo build --release -p balaur_cli                           # the runtime a game ships on
cargo run -p balaur_cli -- export my-game --runtime target/release/balaur
```

Hot reload: run `cargo run -p balaur_cli -- run examples/hello --headless` and edit
`examples/hello/scripts/spinner.rn` while it goes.

## A scene and a script

```toml
# scenes/main.toml
[[nodes]]
name = "Ball"
script = { source = "scripts/ball.rn", props = { speed = 3.5 } }
transform = { position = [0.0, 6.0, 0.0] }        # from balaur_core
body3d = { kind = "dynamic" }                     # from balaur_physics
collider3d = { kind = "ball", radius = 0.5 }      # from balaur_physics
shape3d = { kind = "ball", radius = 0.5 }         # from balaur_render
```

```rust
// scripts/ball.rn
pub fn exports() { #{ speed: 2.0 } }              // what the inspector may tune

pub fn init(this) { this.angle = 0.0; }

pub fn update(this, dt) {                         // per frame; fixed_update is per fixed tick
    this.angle += dt * this.speed;
    this.node.transform.rotation_euler = [0.0, this.angle, 0.0];
}
```

## AI Usage

This project uses AI to aid in software development, and accepts AI contributions. What keeps the code sound is what the industry already does: manual testing, automated testing, an architecture written down, spec docs, linting and benchmarking. [The quality page](https://balaurengine.org/docs/quality/) says what each one covers.

Every bit of code is tested against this pipeline / process.

There is also a lot of observability and documentation which we use, as the codebase is large and it will keep growing, so having a high level understanding of it is very important, as well as a low level one. For that we have both references from code for nodes/properties, but also documentation and blogposts per features:

- https://balaurengine.org/docs/intro/

- https://balaurengine.org/docs/benchmarks/

- https://balaurengine.org/docs/architecture/

- https://balaurengine.org/docs/built-on/

- https://balaurengine.org/blog/

- https://balaurengine.org/docs/reference/
