Hybrid Engine is a long-term implementation playground for understanding how rendering, assets, scene data, editor tooling, input, events, and runtime systems should be structured and how they evolve together.

Current development is mainly focused on:

- reliable editor document transitions, Console, Project Settings, and Game View workflow
- observable asynchronous asset import, metadata, and cooked-cache pipeline
- render architecture cleanup and pass evolution
- play-mode transitions, scene switching, and early physics iteration

## Status Snapshot

| Platform | Toolchain |
| --- | --- |
| Windows 10 / 11, macOS 12+, Linux runtime | Visual Studio 2022 / Apple Clang / GCC / Clang + CMake 3.20+ |

| Rendering | Main Entry |
| --- | --- |
| OpenGL 4.5 on Windows / 4.1 on macOS | `bin\HybridEditor.exe` / `bin/HybridEditor.app` |

| Current Focus | Dev Log |
| --- | --- |
| Editor, asset pipeline, render architecture, scene workflow | `docs/CHANGELOG.md` |

## Requirements

Current primary development environment:

- Windows 10 / 11, or macOS 12 and later
- CMake 3.20 or later
- A compiler with C++17 support
- Visual Studio 2022 / MSVC on Windows; Apple Clang on macOS
- OpenGL 4.5 support on Windows; macOS uses the system OpenGL 4.1 Core Profile

## Build and Run

Initialize submodules first:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Configure and build manually:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build --config Release
ctest --test-dir build -C Release --output-on-failure
```

Or use the Windows helper script:

```bat
build_windows.bat
```

On macOS (with Xcode Command Line Tools and CMake installed):

```bash
./build_macos.sh debug
# or: ./build_macos.sh release
```

Run the editor:

```bat
bin\HybridEditor.exe
```

On macOS:

```bash
open bin/HybridEditor.app
```

Run a project with the standalone player:

```bat
bin\HybridPlayer.exe --project F:\Projects\MyGame\MyGame.hyproj --max-frames 120
bin\HybridPlayer.exe --project F:\Projects\MyGame\MyGame.hyproj --headless --max-frames 10
```

CMake options are `HYBRID_BUILD_EDITOR` (Windows/macOS), `HYBRID_BUILD_PLAYER`, and `BUILD_TESTING`.

Runtime notes:

- The build copies the editor executable, shaders, and editor resources into `bin/`.
- If no project argument is passed, the engine falls back to a debug bootstrap project at `bin/GameProject/GameProject.hyproj`.
- Runtime logs are written to `bin/hybrid_engine.log`.

### Project CLI

Open an existing project:

```bat
bin\HybridEditor.exe --project F:\Projects\MyGame\MyGame.hyproj
```

You can also pass a project directory. The editor will look for a `.hyproj` file in that directory:

```bat
bin\HybridEditor.exe --project F:\Projects\MyGame
```

Create and open a new project:

```bat
bin\HybridEditor.exe --new-project F:\Projects\MyGame
```

Optionally override the project name used for the generated `.hyproj` file:

```bat
bin\HybridEditor.exe --new-project F:\Projects\Sandbox --project-name SandboxGame
```

Notes:

- For the most explicit workflow, prefer passing the absolute path to the `.hyproj` file.
- `--project` and `--new-project` cannot be used together.
- If `--project-name` is omitted, the new project's directory name is used.

- [Editor Workflow Reliability](docs/systems/editor_workflow.md): safe transitions, project settings, async tasks, and stable render views

## Features & Current Status

Already implemented or broadly usable:

- Core runtime foundation: logging, events, input, window system, and main loop
- Rendering baseline: OpenGL backend, framebuffer path, forward rendering, and Scene / Game viewport split
- Scene system: EnTT-based entities and components, scene serialization, hierarchy data, and the `scene_document` flow
- Editor workflow: docking UI, safe dirty-scene exit, Hierarchy, Inspector, Scene/Game views, Project Settings, Console, Tasks, gizmo interaction, and object picking
- Asset-system baseline: VFS logical paths, asset registry, `.meta` files, cooked cache output, and loading for textures, meshes, materials, and scenes
- Import workflow: engine-pool background preparation, main-thread commit/cache invalidation, coalescing, retry/task visibility, OBJ/material/texture import, and hot reload
- Lighting: directional lights and point lights in the current render path
- Physics baseline: AABB collision, collider registration, rigidbody iteration, and collider gizmo debugging

Still under active development:

- The render-pipeline split is still being refined and higher-level pass orchestration is not fully settled yet.
- Shadow, outline, and post-process paths have started but are not complete yet.
- The physics system is still in an early iteration phase and remains unstable overall.
- The editor workflow is reliable for routine scene work; broader undo/redo, packaging, and profiling depth still need work.
- Audio and scripting systems have not been implemented yet.

## Roadmap

Near-term focus:

- continue refining render-pipeline structure, including pass execution flow, shader management, and data upload paths
- improve physics behavior, rigidbody flow, and editor-side debugging support
- build a portable Windows/Linux cook/package pipeline on top of the new project and import contracts
- expand automated editor transition and rendering coverage where platform UI automation is available

Planned future work:

- more complete rendering features such as shadows, outline, and post-process
- a more polished editor workflow and better panel-level usability
- broader coverage for default resources and failure paths in the asset system
- audio-system exploration
- scripting support and runtime extensibility after the core architecture becomes more stable

For the broader plan, see [docs/plans/PROJECT_PLAN_ENG.md](docs/plans/PROJECT_PLAN_ENG.md).
