# Miku 3.0.0

Miku converts Blender 5.x EEVEE materials into target-neutral MaterialIR 2.0,
then imports deterministic, editable Standard PBR Shader Graph assets into
Unity 6 URP. Blender exposes one Standard PBR route; four bundled Game Toon
Shader/HLSL preset families are authored from the Unity Editor.

English is the canonical public documentation language. Read the
[Simplified Chinese README](docs/zh-CN/README.md) or the full
[English Manual](docs/manual.md) / [Chinese Manual](docs/zh-CN/manual.md).

## Highlights

- One visible Blender Standard PBR export route with declared approximations,
  isolated texture baking, deterministic bundles, and time-input preflight.
- Editable Unity Shader Graph wrappers, Miku-owned generated Sub Graphs, stable
  IDs, structured diagnostics, and historical Bundle 1.0 compatibility.
- A Unity material creator at `Miku > Game Toon > Materials > Create Material`
  with explicit texture fields, required-field validation, no asset overwrite,
  and no automatic Renderer, FBX, or Prefab binding.
- Opt-in Endfield tutorial lighting, tangent-space skinned outlines, and a
  project-owned pre-post-process game-LUT installer. See the
  [Endfield 2.3.0 guide](docs/features/endfield-tutorial-rendering.md).
- A clean-room Genshin tutorial implementation, first developed for the
  unpublished 2.4.0 candidate and shipped in 3.0.0, with real tangent-space normal
  maps, explicit UV1 backface/UV7 outline draws, five outline regions, shared
  alpha coverage, and combined Geometry/Screen Rim renderer setup. See the
  [Genshin rendering guide](docs/features/genshin-tutorial-rendering.md).
- WuWa 3.0 tutorial PBR/GI, packed normal-metallic-roughness textures,
  clone-only migration, dedicated outlines, and tutorial Screen Rim. See the
  [WuWa 3.0 guide](docs/features/wuwa-tutorial-rendering.md).
- English/Simplified Chinese Miku Editor UI selected per user at
  `Miku > Settings`.

## Bundled Game Toon Shader/HLSL presets

The Unity package ships first-party, original Miku Shader/HLSL code for four
experimental preset families. These are working shader implementations, not
only field-name templates.

| Preset | Available material parts | Main authored features |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Genshin | Body, Hair, Face, Eye | Light-map/ramp Toon lighting, Face SDF, hair, eye, outline, and screen-rim support |
| Honkai: Star Rail (HSR) | Body, Hair, Face, Eye | Light-map/ramp shading, Face SDF, hair highlights, eyes, and outline support |
| Wuthering Waves (Wuwa) | Body, Hair, Face, Eye, Effect | ID/Stockings dual binding, face basis controls, authored eye maps, highlights, and emission |
| Arknights: Endfield | Body, Skin, Hair, Face, Eye, Mouth, Overlay, Effect, HairShadow | Continuous day/top lighting, three-band ramps, DFG, Face SDF, material-local skin/cloth LUTs, two-layer eye highlights, lit overlays, URP-correct shadows, outlines, and Volume grading |

Together the creator exposes 22 valid material parts. The presets are
**Experimental** compatibility implementations and do not promise pixel-exact
parity with any game. Miku includes no extracted game Shader source, model,
texture, logo, or other game asset. See the [Manual](docs/manual.md) for every
texture rule, the example gallery, and the Unity Editor tool guide.

## Install the release

1. Download `miku_shader_converter-3.0.0.zip`,
   `com.miku.shaderconverter-3.0.0.tgz`, and `SHA256SUMS.txt` from the
   [v3.0.0 release](https://github.com/GenshinmasterJinHang/Miku-Material-Converter-Blender-to-Unity-/releases/tag/v3.0.0).
2. Before installation, run `Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256` on the ZIP and
   TGZ and compare both values with `SHA256SUMS.txt`.
3. In Blender 5.0-5.2, open **Edit > Preferences > Extensions**, choose
   **Install from Disk**, select the ZIP, and enable Miku.
4. In Unity 6000.0-6000.5, open **Window > Package Manager > + > Add package
   from tarball**, then select the single TGZ.
5. Export a material bundle from Blender and copy its complete directory under
   the Unity project's `Assets/` folder.

For a source checkout, add
`unity/Packages/com.miku.shaderconverter/package.json` from disk. Full
installation, ownership, diagnostics, and upgrade guidance are in the
[Manual](docs/manual.md).

## Five-minute workflow

1. Select an object with a material in Blender's Shader Editor.
2. Open the **Miku** sidebar, choose an output directory, and confirm
   **Standard PBR**.
3. Export the current material. A reachable `Input.Time.*` dependency stops
   before output or bake requests are written; disconnected time nodes are
   harmless.
4. Copy the complete `.mikubundle` directory to Unity `Assets/` and let the
   importer create editable graph and report assets.
5. For a Game Toon material, open the Unity creator, choose a preset and part,
   assign the displayed textures, and save a user-owned `.mat`.

## Compatibility and licensing

The validated reference tuple is Blender 5.2.0, Unity 6000.4.5f1, URP 17.4.0,
and Shader Graph 17.4.0 on Windows Direct3D 12. Blender 5.0-5.2 and matching Unity/URP/Shader Graph
technical lines 6000.0/17.0 through 6000.5/17.5 are admitted. Stable patches
outside the recorded validation set run a full capability preflight and emit
an unvalidated warning. Blender 5.3+, Unity 6000.6+, package 17.6+, and
prerelease builds are rejected before generated assets are written. Miku is
currently **Experimental**. MaterialIR 2.0,
Bundle 1.0, conversion-plan, bake-result, and public Shader property/reference
names remain compatible in 3.0.0. See the
[compatibility matrix](docs/compatibility.md).
