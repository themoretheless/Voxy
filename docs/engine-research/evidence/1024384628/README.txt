# Game Engine
### &#9888;&#65039; This project is a work in progress &#9888;&#65039;

Started as a toy engine project to learn Vulkan and advanced rendering techniques, this is now taking the direction of a fully fledged game engine.

There is still a lot to do on the graphics side of things, but currently I am directing my efforts on game/core engine stuff.

Supports Linux and Windows.

## Features:
* Hot reloadable engine modules
* Custom gizmos
* Multi editor viewports
* Graphics abstraction layer
* Shader hot reloading
* Ref counted asset system
* Asset hot reloading
* Highly backward and forward compatible serialization system using manual indices
* Simple CPU profiler
* Simple GPU profiler
* Skinned meshes
* Physically based opaque surface shading
* Image based lighting
* HDR textures
* Cascaded shadow maps
* Parallax occlusion mapping with self shadowing
* Bloom
* Omnidirectional shadow maps
* Clustered forward rendering

## To explore/implement next:
### Graphics:
* Global illumination
* Non pre-baked reflections
* GTAO
* Subsurface scattering
* Volumetric clouds
* Automatic texture transition barriers
* Variance shadow maps
* Particle system
* Only render point shadow maps when something changes
* Use multiple GPU queues concurrently
### Editor:
* Undo/Redo
* Gizmo interaction improvements and rework
* Texture viewer
### Core:
* Async asset loading/asset streaming
* Pipelining
* Input system
### Animation:
* Animation system
* Animation graph (ideally a UE like graph that's more of a general purpose visual scripting tool)
* Animation joint attachments
### Physics:
* Collision detection queries (we can probably use a physics engine)
* Physics engine integration (probably Jolt)

## Goals
* Having a player running, jumping and mantling around (see Unreal Engine Advanced Locomotion System)
* Sponza running at 155 FPS with all point lights casting shadows
