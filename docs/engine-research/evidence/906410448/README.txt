[![CI status](https://github.com/aztecs-hs/aztecs/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/aztecs-hs/aztecs/actions)

A modular game engine and [ECS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system) for Haskell.
An ECS is a modern approach to organizing your application state as a database,
providing patterns for data-oriented design and parallel processing.

[Examples](https://github.com/aztecs-hs/examples)

## Features

- Type-safe: Queries and systems use fully type-checked access with compile-time gurantees
- High-performance: Components are stored by their unique sets in archetypes
- Reactive: Component lifecycle hooks enable change-detection and event-based state management
- Modular design: Aztecs can be extended for a variety of use cases

```hs
newtype Position = Position Int deriving (Show)

instance (Monad m) => Component m Position

newtype Velocity = Velocity Int deriving (Show)

instance (Monad m) => Component m Velocity

move :: (Monad m) => Query m Position
move = queryMapWith go query
  where
    go (Velocity v) (Position p) = Position $ p + v

app :: Access IO ()
app = do
  spawn_ $ bundle (Position 0) <> bundle (Velocity 1)
  positions <- system $ runQuery move
  liftIO $ print positions

main :: IO ()
main = runAccess_ app
```

## Prior art

Aztecs' approach to archetypical ECS is inspired by [Bevy](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/) and [Flecs](https://github.com/SanderMertens/flecs).
