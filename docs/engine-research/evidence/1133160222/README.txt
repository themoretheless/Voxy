## 📖 Overview

**PixelRoot32** is a lightweight, modular 2D game engine written in **C++17**, designed primarily for **ESP32 microcontrollers**, with a native simulation layer for **PC (SDL2)** to enable rapid development without hardware.

The engine follows a scene-based architecture inspired by **Godot Engine**, featuring kinematic controllers, scene transitions, camera effects, and deterministic gameplay systems tailored for embedded hardware.

## 🧠 Engine Philosophy

PixelRoot32 is not the product of a traditional electronics expert or a large engineering team.

It was born from curiosity, experimentation, and a deep love for retro games from the 90s.

Coming from a mobile development background with limited experience in C++, this project represents a leap into embedded systems. This was made possible by how accessible knowledge has become today—especially with AI-assisted tools lowering the barrier to building complex systems.

PixelRoot32 is a reflection of that shift: exploring new domains driven by curiosity rather than specialization.

At its core, the engine is built around a few simple ideas:

- Determinism over convenience  
- No hidden costs (no runtime allocations, no magic)  
- Simplicity and explicit control  
- Performance as a core constraint  
- Retro-inspired design with modern practices

## ✨ Key Features

- **Cross-Platform**: Develop on PC (Windows/Linux/macOS) and deploy on ESP32.
- **Scene-Entity System**: Intuitive management of Scenes, Entities, and Actors.
- **High Performance**: Optimized for ESP32 with DMA transfers, IRAM-cached rendering, and a Dirty Regions pipeline.
- **Sprite System**: Support for 1bpp/2bpp/4bpp sprites with multi-palette selection, flipping, rotation, and animation.
- **Tilemap Support**: Optimized rendering with viewport culling, static layer caching, multi-palette, and tile animations.
- **Tile Animation System**: Frame-based animations (water, lava) with O(1) frame resolution and zero-allocation policy.
- **Scene Transitions**: Built-in Fade, Iris, and Diagonal Wipe transitions with configurable effects and ESP32-optimized rendering.
- **Camera Effects**: Deterministic camera shake, punch, and offset effects designed for low-resource embedded hardware.
- **Independent Resolution Scaling**: Render at low logical resolutions (e.g., 128x128) and scale to physical displays (e.g., 240x240).
- **NES-Style Audio**: Dynamic 8-voice subsystem with a fixed **4+4 partition** (melodic tracks vs percussion/SFX), advanced SFX synthesis (loops, sweeps, breakpoint envelopes, `playSfxBank`), and fixed-point No-FPU optimizations (Pulse, Triangle, Noise, Sine, Saw).
- **Lightweight UI**: Label, Button, and Checkbox with automatic layouts.
- **AABB Physics**: Godot-style physics with Kinematic/Rigid actors, one-way platforms, moving platform support, floor velocity inheritance, and custom hitboxes.
- **Gameplay Framework**: Opt-in building blocks — grid space, state machines, object pools, an event bus, interaction triggers, room graphs, camera tweens, depth sorting and spatial queries — each behind its own `PIXELROOT32_ENABLE_*` flag, all default `0`.
- **Indexed Color Palettes**: Optimized palettes (PR32, NES, GameBoy, PICO-8) with multi-palette support.
- **Modular Architecture**: Compile only needed subsystems via `PIXELROOT32_ENABLE_*` flags to reduce firmware size.

| UI · Input · Performance | 6 | menus, digital and touch controls, and profiling vehicles |

Every demo is a standalone PlatformIO project that builds against the
**published release** from the registry — copy the folder anywhere, run
`pio run -e native`, and you have a working starting point.

**How it differs from [`examples/`](examples/) in this repository:** the
examples here are five minimal projects, each isolating a single engine
capability, and none of them is a game. Read an example to learn one API; read a
demo to see several of them working together in something finished.

## Quick Start

### ⚠️ Configuration Requirement

To compile PixelRoot32, you **must** configure your `platformio.ini` to use C++17 and disable exceptions:

```ini
build_unflags = -std=gnu++11
build_flags =
    -std=gnu++17
    -fno-exceptions
```

### Prerequisites

- **VS Code + PlatformIO**
- **ESP32 DevKit** or **SDL2** (for PC simulation)

### 📦 Installation (via PlatformIO)

To use PixelRoot32 in your own project, add the following to the `lib_deps` option of your `platformio.ini`:

```ini
lib_deps =
    gperez88/PixelRoot32-Game-Engine@^1.11.0
```

PlatformIO will automatically download and install the library and its dependencies during the next build — including the shared [PixelRoot32-APU](https://registry.platformio.org/libraries/gperez88/PixelRoot32-APU) synthesis core (also used by the PixelRoot32 Tool Suite).

### Fast Setup

1. **Clone this repository** and open an example under [`examples/`](examples/):

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PixelRoot32-Game-Engine/PixelRoot32-Game-Engine.git
   cd PixelRoot32-Game-Engine/examples/sprites
   ```

   Each folder (`sprites`, `camera`, `animated_tilemap`, `physics`, `mono_oled`) is a **standalone PlatformIO project** with its own `platformio.ini`. See the [examples catalogue](examples/README.md) for what each one demonstrates and which opt-in capability it turns on. Complete games and larger use cases live in [**PixelRoot32-Demo-Projects**](https://github.com/PixelRoot32-Game-Engine/PixelRoot32-Demo-Projects).

2. **Open that example folder in VS Code** (File → Open Folder) and select your environment (`env:esp32dev`, `env:esp32cyd`, `env:esp32c3`, or `env:native`).
3. **Build and Upload** using PlatformIO.

> 📚 **More information:** See the [Getting Started Guide](https://docs.pixelroot32.org/).

## 🛠️ Best Practices

To ensure high performance on ESP32, PixelRoot32 enforces strict development patterns:

1. **Fixed-Point Math**: Always use `Scalar` instead of `float`. Use `math::toScalar()` for literals.
2. **Zero Allocation**: Avoid `new`/`malloc` during the game loop. Use **Object Pooling** and `std::unique_ptr`.
3. **Render Layers**: Organize entities by `renderLayer` (0=Bg, 1=Game, 2=UI) to optimize drawing order.
4. **Platform Memory**: Use `PIXELROOT32_FLASH_ATTR` and `PIXELROOT32_READ_*_P` macros for cross-platform Flash/RAM access.
5. **Centralized Logging**: Use `log()` from `core/Log.h` instead of `Serial.print` or `printf`.

> 📘 **Essential Reading**: Check the **[Style & Best Practices Guide](docs/guide/index.md#-standards-&-compatibility)** for detailed rules on memory management, performance optimization, and coding style.

## 🕒 Changelog

## 1.11.0

Introduces a **dialog system** and **accented Latin text**. Both are opt-in behind build flags that default to `0`. ASCII text measures and renders exactly as in 1.10.0; the one API change is that `FontManager::getGlyphIndex` now returns `uint16_t` (see Changed).

### 💬 Dialog

- **`DialogRunner` (`PIXELROOT32_ENABLE_DIALOG`)**: a headless dialog state machine for text lines, auto-advancing lines, paged text and choices. It is driven only by semantic `feed(DialogAction)` and `update(deltaTimeMs)` calls, has no `Renderer`, `InputManager` or `Font` dependency, and reports lines and confirmed choices through one event callback. The script is a caller-owned `const` table in flash. A session allocates nothing on the heap, and the runner is 28 B on ESP32.
- **`DialogBox`**: an optional default panel for a runner. It draws the border, speaker label, the current page of wrapped text and a single-column option list whose selection is marked twice: `inkSelected` plus a `choiceCaret` glyph drawn in `ink`, so it stays visible on a palette that leaves the highlight colour unset. One layout function feeds both drawing and `choiceRect()` touch hit-testing, so the two cannot drift apart, and `measureHeightPx()` sizes a panel for a whole script. It is not a `UIElement`, so it works with the UI system off.
- **`DialogTypes`**: `DialogLine`, `DialogChoice` and `DialogScript`, the data model a game authors its script in.

### 🔤 Text & Fonts

- **Accented Latin characters (`PIXELROOT32_ENABLE_FONT_LATIN1`)**: renders `á é í ó ú ü ñ Á É Í Ó Ú Ü Ñ ¿ ¡ « » º` from ordinary UTF-8 string literals, with no compiler charset flag. Accented capitals keep the same baseline as unaccented ones.
- **`TextLayout`**: glyph-accurate word wrap and measurement (`wrap()`, `measureWidthPx()`, `countWrappedLines()`), allocation-free, with page skipping so a presenter never wraps the same text twice. It is always available, with no flag.
- **`Font` supplement block**: optional extra glyphs appended to the struct, so every existing font initializer keeps compiling.

### 🔧 Changed

- `FontManager::getGlyphIndex` returns `uint16_t` and reports "not found" as `FontManager::kNoGlyph` (`0xFFFF`) instead of `255`, which was itself a legal glyph index. **Migration:** replace comparisons against `255` and stop storing the result in a `uint8_t`. Neither mistake fails to compile, so check call sites by hand.
- `textWidth` and `drawTextCentered` measure per glyph instead of per byte, so they agree with `drawText` for multi-byte text. ASCII strings are unaffected.

Reference consumer: [`examples/dialog`](examples/dialog), which shows an auto-advancing line, a speaker chain and a branching three-option choice.
