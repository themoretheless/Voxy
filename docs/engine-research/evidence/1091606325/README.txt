## ❓ What is SoonFx?

<img src="assets/editor.gif" align="right" width="250" style="margin-left: 6px;" alt="SoonFx Editor Preview">

SoonFx is a **TypeScript-first numeric engine** designed specifically for games. It addresses the common challenge of managing complex game logic, formulas, and numeric relationships that often become hardcoded "spaghetti code."

### 🚫 The Problem

In many game projects, damage calculations, resource production rates, and other numeric logic are hardcoded directly into the source code.

*   **Hard to maintain**: Formulas are buried in nested if-else statements.
*   **Slow iteration**: Designers need engineers to change a simple constant or formula structure.
*   **Bug prone**: Copy-pasting logic leads to subtle errors.

### ✅ The Solution

SoonFx decouples **logic** from **code**.

1.  **Logic as Data**: Formulas and relationships are defined as data (JSON).
2.  **Runtime Execution**: The engine parses and executes this data safely at runtime.
3.  **Visual Tooling**: Designers use the [SoonFx Editor](https://github.com/soonfx-engine/editor) to visually build these relationships.

---

## 🎨 Visual Editor Driven

Stop hardcoding formulas. Build them visually.

**SoonFx Runtime** is the engine that powers the **[SoonFx Editor](https://github.com/soonfx-engine/editor)**. It allows game designers to configure complex logic without writing a single line of code, while developers can safely execute it at runtime.

### The Workflow

1.  **Design**: Designers create formulas, skill effects, and attribute relationships in the **Visual Editor**.
2.  **Export**: The editor generates a JSON configuration file.
3.  **Run**: The **SoonFx Runtime** loads this JSON and executes the logic in your game.

> **Note**: While SoonFx Runtime can be used standalone for math and expressions, its true power is unlocked when paired with the Editor.

## 💡 Use Cases

SoonFx is designed for numeric-heavy game genres:

*   ⚔️ **RPG Systems**: Skill damage, character stats growth, equipment bonuses, combat power (CP) calculations.
*   🏰 **SLG / Strategy**: Resource production rates, building upgrade timers, marching times, tech tree requirements.
*   🃏 **Card Games**: Dynamic card values, synergy effects, deck balancing simulation.
*   📊 **Simulation**: Complex economy models, probability calculations.

## 🚀 For Users

To use this library in your project:

```bash
npm install @soonfx/engine
```

## 📦 Development Setup

Clone and setup the development environment:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/soonfx-engine/core.git
cd core

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build

# Run examples
cd examples
npm install
npm run dev
```

## 🎯 Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```typescript
import { fx } from '@soonfx/engine';

// 1. Mathematical utilities
const distance = fx.distance(0, 0, 10, 10);
console.log('Distance between points:', distance); // 14.142135623730951

// 2. Expression evaluation
const result = fx.evaluateExpression('(2 + 3) * 4');
console.log('Expression result:', result); // 20

// 3. Numeric processing
const fixed = fx.fixedDecimal(3.14159, 2);
console.log('Fixed to 2 decimals:', fixed); // 3.14
```

### Event System

```typescript
import { Eve, Call, CallCenter } from '@soonfx/engine';

// Create event call center
const callCenter = new CallCenter();

// Listen to events
callCenter.addEventListener(Eve.SHIFT_ADD_BOARD, (data) => {
    console.log('Board added event triggered:', data);
});

// Send events
Call.send(Eve.ADD_DATABASE_DATA, [data, body, index]);
```

## 📚 Core API

### Mathematical Utilities (fx)

#### Vector and Geometry Operations
```typescript
// Calculate distance between two points
const distance = fx.distance(x1, y1, x2, y2);

// Vector dot product
const dotProduct = fx.dot(p1x, p1y, p2x, p2y);

// Vector cross product
const crossProduct = fx.cross(p1x, p1y, p2x, p2y);

// Calculate vector length
const length = fx.length(a, b);

// Coordinate transformation
const coord = fx.coordinate(x, y, angle, distance);
```

### Game Characters (Player)

The `Player` class provides character attributes, battle calculations, and combat simulation. See the [Examples](#-examples) section below for complete battle system demonstrations.
