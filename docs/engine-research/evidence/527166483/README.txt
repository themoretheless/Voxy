A cross platform 2D/3D graphics runtime for [Go](https://go.dev/) suitable for building native mobile apps,
gdextensions, multimedia applications, games and more.

_Why use graphics.gd?_

* [Faster](https://github.com/quaadgras/graphics.gd/discussions/277) than GDScript.
* [Write shaders in Go!](./shaders/Readme.md)
* Full compatibility with the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) editor and ecosystem.
* Unlike C++/C#/GDScript/Rust/Swift, RIDs, Callables and Dictionary arguments are strongly typed.
* Fully documented API reference on [pkg.go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/graphics.gd), with all code snippets in Go.
* Pure-Go ported `variant` packages, for vector math and more, reuse them in any Go project.
* After an initial build, recompile quickly, with an experience similar to scripting languages.
* Easily cross-compile for windows/macos/android/linux/ios/web on any host platform.
* Neither Java, nor an Android SDK/NDK is needed to build Android apps [Read More](https://github.com/quaadgras/graphics.gd/discussions/177).
* Neither Xcode nor macOS is needed to build macOS/iOS apps [Read More](https://github.com/quaadgras/graphics.gd/discussions/184).
* Drop in `gd` command, a cross-platform build tool compatible with `.gd` script projects.
* Export static `GOOS=musl` binaries that will run on any linux system (no more libc issues).
* Designed for readablity by humans (but your LLM will manage too).

Not just a 1:1 wrapper for gdextension! `graphics.gd` has been designed from the ground up to
provide a cohesive and curated experience for using [Go](https://go.dev/) on top of
[Godot](https://godotengine.org/) +
[GDExtension](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdextension/what_is_gdextension.html).

## Hello World

```go
// This file is all you need to start a project.
// Save it somewhere, install the `gd` command and use `gd run` to launch.
package main

import (
	"graphics.gd/startup"

	"graphics.gd/classdb/Control"
	"graphics.gd/classdb/GUI"
	"graphics.gd/classdb/Label"
	"graphics.gd/classdb/SceneTree"
)

func main() {
	startup.LoadingScene() // setup the SceneTree and wait until we have access to engine functionality
	hello := Label.New()
	hello.AsControl().SetAnchorsPreset(Control.PresetFullRect) // expand the label to take up the whole screen.
	hello.SetHorizontalAlignment(GUI.HorizontalAlignmentCenter)
	hello.SetVerticalAlignment(GUI.VerticalAlignmentCenter)
	hello.SetText("Hello, World!")
	SceneTree.Add(hello)
	startup.Scene() // starts up the scene and blocks until the engine shuts down.
}
```

## Quickstart
The module includes a drop-in replacement for the go command called `gd` that
makes it easy to work with projects that run within the runtime (including `.gd`
script projects). It also enables you to start developing a new project starting from
a single  `main.go` file, to install it, make sure that your `$GOPATH/bin` is in your
`$PATH` and run:

$ `go install graphics.gd/cmd/gd@release`

Now you can run `gd run`, `gd test` anywhere in your project and things should work 
as expected. For Go projects, `gd` will create a "graphics" subdirectory at the root of 
your module where you can manage your assets via the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) editor.

Running the command without any additional arguments will startup the editor.

If you don't want to use the `gd` command, you can also build a shared library with
the standard `go` command (this can be included in an existing
[Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) project):

$ `go build -o example.so -buildmode=c-shared`

## Next Steps

Check out the [the.graphics.gd/guide](https://the.graphics.gd/guide) which covers much,
much more!

There are also a number of example projects in the [samples](https://github.com/quaadgras/graphics.gd/tree/samples)
branch. All of these samples are designed to be able to run with `gd run` without any additional setup.

## TLDR

Each engine class is available as a package under `classdb`. To import the
`Node` class you can import `"graphics.gd/classdb/Node"` There's no inheritance,
so to access a 'super' class, you need to call `AsClassName()` on an extension 'class'.
All engine classes have methods to cast to any classes that they extend from, for example
`AsObject()` or `AsNode2D()`.

Methods have been renamed to follow Go conventions, so instead of
underscores, methods are named as PascalCase. Keep this in mind when
referring to Godot documentation.

https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/index.html

The complete API reference for Godot has been ported to Go, including code snippets, so you
can use `pkg.go.dev` as a drop-in replacement for Godot's API documentation.

https://pkg.go.dev/graphics.gd

**Note**
Optional arguments are omitted by default, convert an `Instance` into either the `MoreArgs`
or `Advanced` types to specify them.

```go
node.MoreArgs().AddChild(...)
```

## Where Do I Find?
Ctrl+F in the project for a specific `//gd:symbol` to find the matching Go symbol.
```
* Engine Class           -> `//gd:ClassName`
* Engine Class Method    -> `//gd:ClassName.method_name`
* Utility Functions      -> `//gd:utility_function_name`
* Enum                   -> `//gd:ClassName.EnumName`
```
_NOTE_ in order to avoid circular dependencies, a small selection of functions have moved
packages, for example `Node.get_tree()` (GDScript) has moved to `SceneTree.Get()` (Go).

## Community & Support

Join the [active discussions](https://github.com/quaadgras/graphics.gd/discussions)
with any questions, comments or feedback you may have. Show us what you're building!

The API surface of the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) is huge, not everything has
been translated to Go optimally, the best thing you can do is to
[report](https://github.com/quaadgras/graphics.gd/issues/new/choose)
anything that seems 'off', this way you can reduce the likelihood of being affected by any
breaking changes in the future.

*Public sponsors receive priority support!*

## Performance
It's feasible to write high performance code with `graphics.gd`, keep to allocation-efficient types
where possible and avoid allocating memory on the heap in frequently called functions. `Advanced`
instances are available for each class which allow more fine-grained control over memory allocations.

Benchmarks show that `Advanced` method calls from Go -> Godot don't typically allocate any
memory.

## Supported Platforms

* Windows `GOOS=windows gd build`
* Linux   `GOOS=linux gd build`
* MacOS   `GOOS=macos gd build`
* Android `GOOS=android GOARCH=arm64 gd run`
* IOS     `GOOS=ios gd run` (requires [SideStore](https://sidestore.io) on the IOS device)
* Web     `GOOS=web gd run`

## Platform Restrictions

* 64bit only (`arm64`, `amd64` and `wasm`).
* No support for Playstation/Xbox/Switch yet (achievable in the future with [gd-compiler](https://github.com/quaadgras/gd-compiler), [TamaGo](https://github.com/usbarmory/tamago), [WASI](https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI), [wasm2c](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt/tree/main/wasm2c) or [hitsumabushi](https://github.com/hajimehoshi/hitsumabushi)).

## Contributing

The best way you can contribute to `graphics.gd` is to **try it**, this project needs you to find out
what works best and what doesn't, so do please let us know of any trouble that you run into! Any
examples you can contribute are more than welcome.

The next best thing you can do to help is improve the Variant packages, these are general-purpose
packages inspired by the Godot engine's Variant types. Specifically any changes you can make to
optimize functionality and/or improve test coverage of these packages is more than welcome.

If you enjoy hunting down memory-safety issues, we would appreciate this.

`graphics.gd` is looking for someone to create benchmarks to compare this project with `.gd` script
and/or other gdextension-based alternatives.

The project also needs more tests to ensure that everything is working, the best way you can
guarantee that graphics.gd won't break on you is to contribute tests that cover any functionality
that you need!

To run the go tests for `graphics.gd`, cd into the repo and run `cd internal && gd test`.

Another great way to contribute, is to write a blog, share a post or let others know about your
experience with `graphics.gd`!
