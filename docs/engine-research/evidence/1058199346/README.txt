# Archon Engine

A Unity-based game engine for grand strategy games, built around a dual-layer architecture that separates deterministic simulation from GPU-accelerated presentation.

 ~~APIs should be stable by 2026 Q1. Until a release pops up, production use is discouraged.~~
 
I was being too optimistic about release. CORE is basically done. You can use that fine.

MAP namespace I'm not satisfied with yet. All the rendering stuff is giving me a serious headache. Remain cautious with future updates.

Personally wouldn't use this state for production, though you can certainly build something cool right now.

**Note:** Game data (maps, scenarios) is not included - you'll need to provide your own or use the StarterKit's template data.

## Why

Grand strategy is notorious for being extremely complex. Even for experienced studios it's a daunting task to set everything up. It essentially has given monopoly to Paradox, with only exceptionally few coming close to their quality and scale. And for good reason.

Some extreme hurdles for Paradox-like grand strategy:
- Vector like graphics to scale infinitely
- Create beautiful maps from simple bitmaps/pngs
- Fixed-Point arithmetic & deterministic simulation
- Data oriented design (not OOP)
- AI, Diplomacy, Military, Economy as core pillars
- Modifiers, resources, relations, unit movements, sparse storage
- Modding capability

I could go on.

Archon-Engine is designed to be generic infrastructure, providing everything you need from day 1. You can focus on creating content rather than researching the 1% topics barely anyone knows about.

**This not a dunk on Paradox.** I love their games. I just wish they didn't lag so goddamn much.

**This does NOT mean it will be easy developing.** I've tried my best to make it approachable with Wiki, StarterKit, API page, various docs etc. However Grand Strategy is inherently complex and it will still take a LONG time to get going.

## Installation

### Option 1: Git Submodule (Recommended)
```bash
cd YourUnityProject/Assets
git submodule add https://github.com/YourUsername/Archon-Engine.git Archon-Engine
```

### Option 2: Manual Download
1. Download/clone the repository
2. Copy the `Archon-Engine` folder into your Unity project's `Assets/` folder

### After Installation
1. Open your Unity project - let it import and compile
2. Install required packages via **Window → Package Manager → + → Add by name**:
   - `com.unity.nuget.newtonsoft-json` (JSON parsing)
   - `com.unity.transport` (Multiplayer networking)
3. Open the StarterKit scene: `Assets/Archon-Engine/Scenes/StarterKit.unity`
4. Press Play to verify everything works

### Requirements
- Unity 6000+ (2023.3+, latest LTS recommended)
- Universal Render Pipeline (URP)
- Burst Compiler enabled
- UI Toolkit

## Core Architecture

**Dual-Layer Design**
```
┌──────────────────────────────────┐
│   Map Layer (Presentation)       │
│   - Texture-based rendering      │
│   - GPU compute shaders          │
│   - Single draw call             │
└───────────┬──────────────────────┘
            │ Events (one-way)
            ↓
┌──────────────────────────────────┐
│   Core Layer (Simulation)        │
│   - 8-byte province structs      │
│   - Fixed-point deterministic    │
│   - Command pattern              │
└──────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key Design Decisions**
- **Fixed-size data**: 8-byte `ProvinceState` structs prevent late-game performance degradation
- **Deterministic math**: Fixed-point calculations (no floats) for multiplayer-ready simulation
- **Texture-based map**: Provinces rendered as pixels, not GameObjects (single draw call)
- **GPU compute shaders**: All visual processing (borders, effects) on GPU
- **Command pattern**: All state changes go through commands for determinism and networking
- **Zero allocations**: Hot paths use pre-allocated memory and value types

## What Makes This Different

**Rendering Performance:**
- Single draw call for entire map
- 3D MAP TO BE DETERMINED

**Multiplayer:**
- Lockstep command synchronization (working)
- Player-hosted sessions with lobby system
- Time sync across all clients
- Automatic desync detection and recovery
- Deterministic fixed-point math (no floats in simulation)

**Stress test (2026-02-04):**

15000x6500 map, 97.5M pixels, 50k provinces, 665 countries. Ran in editor with i9-14900K & RTX 4070 S

Mapload
- Full load in **~10 seconds**
- Aggressive raw caching: skip decompression on repeat loads (<100ms cache hits)
- GPU-direct: compute shader samples textures already on GPU, zero CPU conversion
  
Stability
- 100 game-years at 100x speed: avg 570-621 FPS, no late-game degradation
- Monthly tick: avg 1.8-2.8ms
- Memory stable: ~1430MB managed, ~3530MB total - flat over 100 years

*Using StarterKit systems (economy, AI, buildings, diplomacy) on a large dataset — not a full game complexity scale. Real games with more systems and mechanics will have higher overhead.*
