Empo is a game launcher for iPhone and iPad. It runs RPG Maker XP, VX, VX Ace, MV, and MZ games, Pokemon Essentials games, and PSDK games. RPG Maker games run on [mkxp-z-apple-mobile](https://github.com/mateo-m/mkxp-z-apple-mobile), an iOS fork of the [mkxp-z](https://github.com/mkxp-z/mkxp-z) engine. PSDK games run on [psdk-apple-mobile](https://github.com/mateo-m/psdk-apple-mobile), an iOS build of LiteRGSS2 and SFML with one Ruby for each PSDK release type. RPG Maker MV and MZ games bring their own JavaScript engine, and run in a web view.

The name's from _emporos_, ancient Greek for a traveler riding on someone else's ship.

## Highlights

- Plays games made for RGSS1 (XP), RGSS2 (VX), RGSS3 (VX Ace), modern mkxp-z forks, PSDK, and RPG Maker MV and MZ.
- **Seven Ruby versions in one app.** Empo includes Ruby 1.8, 1.9, and 3.1 for RPG Maker games, and Ruby 2.5, 3.0, 3.2, and 3.3 for PSDK games. Each game runs on the version it was written for. Newer Pokemon Essentials games that ship a `ruby300.dll` run on Ruby 3.1, and Empo rewrites their older syntax as needed. See [`ios/Empo/docs/multi-ruby.md`](ios/Empo/docs/multi-ruby.md).
- Imports games from folders or archives (`.zip`, `.7z`, `.rar`, JoiPlay's `.jgp`, self-extractable `.exe`).
- On-screen D-pad and action buttons you can move and resize. Layouts can differ per game and per screen orientation.
- Pause and resume from the library.
- Library with sort, search, grid/list views, and bulk delete.

## Status

Pre-release. Not on the App Store.

The app works end to end with RGSS1/2/3 games, modern mkxp-z forks, and PSDK games. Per-game compatibility reports are welcome (open an issue).

Each tagged release on the [Releases page](https://github.com/mateo-m/empo-app/releases) includes pre-built unsigned `.ipa` files. Install them with [AltStore](https://altstore.io), [SideStore](https://sidestore.io) or [Sideloadly](https://sideloadly.io).

AltStore/SideStore users can add Empo as a source for native update notifications:

```text
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mateo-m/empo-app/main/altstore-source.json
```

### Limitations

- **One game per session.** After you exit a Ruby game (RPG Maker XP, VX, VX Ace or PSDK), close Empo from the app switcher and reopen it to start a different one. MV and MZ games do not have this limit. This limit stays until Ruby can clear its state reliably. See [`ios/Empo/docs/multi-session.md`](ios/Empo/docs/multi-session.md).
- **Ogg and Theora movies only.** The engine skips MP4 and other formats without a message.
- **Windows-only code.** Some games call Windows functions that the engine's `win32_wrap.rb` does not copy. Those games can fail to load some files.

## How it works

```text
cores/                 One folder per core: its release pin, bridge, and framework build
ios/Empo/              The app (SwiftUI + UIKit for touch controls)
ios/Dependencies/      The downloaded core releases and ANGLE
docs/                  Notes on the harder parts
```

The [documentation site](https://empo.mateo.sh/) covers the rest: how to
install and play, what game developers can ship with a game, and how the harder parts of the
app work. The source is in [`docs/`](docs/README.md). To read it in a browser locally, run:

```sh
bun install
bun run docs:dev
```

## Importing games

Empo accepts these input shapes:

- A folder with a standard RPG Maker `Game.exe` and `Data/` layout.
- A PSDK game folder with `Game.rb` and `Game.yarb`.
- A `.zip`, `.7z`, or `.rar` archive with the same content.
- A `.jgp` (JoiPlay Game Package) manifest that points at game files.

Drag any of these onto the Empo icon, share them from another app, or use the Files picker from the library's import button. Empo identifies the engine and its version, picks the correct game core and Ruby interpreter, and extracts artwork from `Game.exe` if present. Empo writes everything to its sandbox, so the original imported folder stays unchanged.

## Contributing

Issues, ideas, and PRs are welcome. Game compatibility reports help the most: open an issue with the game title, the game version, and a description of what went wrong.
