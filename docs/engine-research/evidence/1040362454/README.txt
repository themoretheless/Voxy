**Perro** is an experimental, open-source game engine written in **Rust**. With a focus on performance and simplicity without sacrificing either.

## Philosophy

- **Simple To Learn**: start with scenes, nodes, and Rust scripts without large registration steps or boilerplate.
- **Flexible To Use**: reduces borrow-checker friction with direct APIs and scoped closures for mutable access. Separating state from script behavior prevents runtime borrow failures.
- **Fast In Release**: nodes and scripts are laid out for efficient node and state access, all resources are statically baked in release for efficient and quick retrieval

## Design Goals

- **Full Game-Making Scope**: 2D, 3D, and UI all matter. Perro aims to support both 2D and 3D performantly, with high frame rates and a workflow that stays simple.
- **Simple Start**: get first scene and script running quickly, with minimal setup and no script-registration boilerplate.
- **Compiler-Managed Workflow**: let Perro sync scripts, generate glue code, and prepare supported assets so project setup stays small.
- **Split Model**: scripts are just Rust files (lifecycle + methods); they store #[State] structs which each instance gets a copy of.
- **Safe Mutation**: access through `NodeID` closures and engine-managed storage avoids borrow-contention edge cases in normal gameplay code (no "try_get_mut" fails).
- **Fast Access**: flat ID lookups keep common node/script operations efficient, with room to cache IDs for hot paths.
- **Quick Iteration**: project scripts build and reload in usually less than 1 second after initial compilation.

## Game Engineering Workflow

Project scripts use a small, predictable shape. Put per-instance data in a
`#[State]` struct, lifecycle callbacks in `lifecycle!`, and methods in
`methods!`:

```rust
#[derive(Default, Variant)]
struct MotionState {
    speed: f32,
}

#[State]
struct GameState {
    score: i32,
    motion: MotionState,
}

lifecycle!({
    fn on_update(&self, ctx: &mut ScriptContext<'_, API>) {
        self.internal_method(ctx);
    }
});

methods!({
    // GameState methods

    fn internal_method(&self, ctx: &mut ScriptContext<'_, API>) {
        // private, lifecycle-local logic
    }

    pub fn externally_callable_method(&self, ctx: &mut ScriptContext<'_, API>) {
        // externally callable entry point
    }
});
```

The state type may use any clear name. Group related values in nested structs
when that keeps one script readable. Keep same-script helpers private with
`fn`; mark methods `pub fn` only when other scripts, signals, or generated
dispatch need to call them.

Good: keep durable per-node fields in `#[State]`; group related fields in nested structs.
Good: call private methods from lifecycle callbacks; keep free helpers pure.
Bad: pass `ScriptContext` or `ScriptAPI` into free functions; use lifecycle or methods instead.
Bad: default gameplay state to `Mutex`, `RefCell`, or `thread_local!`.

Author scene topology, child nodes, script attachments, refs, and defaults in
composable `.scn` files. Do not construct authored scene trees in gameplay code.
Use runtime scene APIs to load or instantiate authored `.scn` assets when runtime
composition needs them. Engine internals, tests, and editor/tooling may build
nodes when their job requires it.

Treat `res/**/*.rs` and `.scn` files as source. Treat `.perro/` generated glue
as output: inspect it for diagnosis, never edit it as source.

## Dev Checks

- `cargo check --workspace --all-targets`
- `cargo test --workspace`
- `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings -F clippy::all`

## Major Features

- **Behavior Scripts + Per-Node State**: a script is function entry points (lifecycle hooks + methods), not a mutable behavior object. When a node binds that script, runtime uses that node’s `ctx.id` to run behavior and resolve that node’s own `#[State]` via `with_state!`/`with_state_mut!`.
- **Object-Centric Scene Model**: parent/child relationships, concrete node types, and traditional game-object structure stay front and center.
- **Compiler-Backed Asset Flow**: dev stays flexible with plain files, while build/export bakes supported assets into fast static lookup paths and packs the rest.
- **Powerful UI System**: UI is built as a real engine system with relative sizing, clamping, and layouts designed to scale from simple menus to larger game interfaces.
- **Flat ID-Based Runtime Access**: node and script data are addressed by `NodeID`, enabling constant-time lookups for common operations and efficient cross-system interaction.
- **Predictable Failure Modes**: most runtime misses come from real-world state changes (deleted node, missing tag/name match, unbound script), not from borrow contention between unrelated systems (no `try_get_mut` runtime errors).
- **Powerful Query Layer**: if you prefer query-style access, filter by type, base type, tag, name, and subtree to gather `NodeID`s, then operate directly through script/node APIs. See [Query System](docs/scripting/query_system.md).
