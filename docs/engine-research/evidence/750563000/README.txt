## Features

### Screenshots

### Web Based Admin Tools

There are comprehensive web based admin tools to help build your MUD in addition to the in-game commands. You can browse the admin in read-only mode here:

### ANSI Colors

Colorization is handled through extensive use of my [github.com/GoMudEngine/ansitags](https://github.com/GoMudEngine/ansitags) library.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Go 1.24 or newer
- Optional: Docker (for container-based runs)

### Quick Install

The fastest way to get GoMud running. These scripts install Go and Git if needed, clone the repo, and build the server binary automatically.

**Linux / macOS:**

```shell
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GoMudEngine/GoMud/master/scripts/install.sh | sh
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GoMudEngine/GoMud/master/scripts/install.ps1 | iex
```

Both scripts install GoMud to `~/GoMud` by default. Set the `GOMUD_DIR` environment variable before running to choose a different location.

### Manual Setup

If you prefer to clone and run the server yourself:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/GoMudEngine/GoMud.git
cd GoMud

make reset-admin-pw   # set a new admin password before first run
make run              # build and start the server
```

To run inside Docker instead:

```shell
make run-docker
```

Other useful commands:

```shell
make build        # compile a standalone binary at ./go-mud-server
make run-new      # delete generated room instance data and start fresh
make help         # list all available make targets
```

### Connecting to Your Server

Once the server is running, you can connect in several ways:

| Method | Address |
|---|---|
| Telnet (public) | `localhost:33333` or `localhost:44444` |
| Telnet (local only) | `127.0.0.1:9999` |
| Web client | [http://localhost/webclient](http://localhost/webclient) |
| Web admin | [http://localhost/admin/](http://localhost/admin/) |

The web client is the easiest way to jump in without installing a separate telnet client.

### First Login

Before starting the server for the first time, run:

```shell
make reset-admin-pw
```

This sets a password of your choosing for the built-in `admin` account. If you skip this step, the server starts with the default credentials `admin` / `password`, which you should change immediately.

The admin account gives you access to in-game admin commands as well as the web-based admin panel at `http://localhost/admin/`.

## Community Modules

GoMud supports optional community modules that add new gameplay features, commands, events, and more. Modules are compiled into the server binary, so they are fast and have full access to the engine.

### Module Manager

The module manager is built into the server binary. Run it via the `module`
subcommand — no separate tool needed:

```shell
go run . module
```

Running it with no arguments and an interactive terminal launches an interactive menu. You can also pass subcommands directly (see below).

A `make module` shortcut is also available if you prefer:

```shell
make module list
make module install <name>
```

### Available Commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `go run . module list` | List all modules available in the registry |
| `go run . module info <name>` | Show full details for a specific module |
| `go run . module install <name>` | Download, verify, and install a module |
| `go run . module remove <name>` | Remove an installed module |
| `go run . module update` | Check for updates to all installed modules |
| `go run . module update <name>` | Update a specific installed module |

With a built binary, replace `go run .` with `./go-mud-server`.

### After Installing or Removing a Module

Modules are compiled into the server binary, so a rebuild is required for any change to take effect:

```shell
make build
```

If a newly installed module depends on a Go package not already in `go.mod`, run `go mod tidy` before building.

The manager records what is installed in `modules/modules.lock.yaml`. This file is managed automatically - do not edit it by hand. You can commit it to source control to track which community modules your server uses.

## Configuration

### Config Files

GoMud loads configuration in layers so you can keep your own world-specific changes separate from the bundled defaults:

```text
_datafiles/config.yaml
  -> FilePaths.DataFiles (defaults to _datafiles/world/default)
      -> {DataFiles}/config-overrides.yaml
          -> environment variables such as CONFIG_PATH, LOG_PATH, LOG_LEVEL, LOG_NOCOLOR
```

- `_datafiles/config.yaml` is the bundled base config that ships with the repo, and shouldn't be edited or changed.
- `FilePaths.DataFiles` points at the active world data directory. By default that is `_datafiles/world/default`.
- `{DataFiles}/config-overrides.yaml` is the normal place to save local overrides for a world.
- `CONFIG_PATH=/path/to/config.yaml` can point GoMud at a different override file when you want to keep it outside the repo or maintain separate deploy-specific settings.

- For upgrades, treat `_datafiles/config.yaml` as a reference file, not your day-to-day edit target. 
= Keep your custom changes in `config-overrides.yaml` or a separate file selected with `CONFIG_PATH` so pulling new code does not overwrite your local settings.

### Enable Server HTTPS Support

GoMud can serve HTTPS when you provide a certificate and private key, or can be automated using LetsEncrypt provisioning.

For a guided HTTPS setup process, run:

```shell
make https-setup
```

When the admin interface is enabled, `/admin/https/` shows the current HTTPS mode, the checks GoMud ran, and the next steps needed to finish setup.

### Build Commands

| Command            | Description                                                                 |

### Env Vars

When running, several environment variables can be set to alter behaviors of the mud:

| Variable      | Example Value                   | Descripton                           |
|---------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------|

| `LOG_PATH`    | `/path/to/log.txt`              | Log to file instead of stderr        |
| `LOG_LEVEL`   | `LOW` / `MEDIUM` / `HIGH`       | Set verbosity (rotates at 100MB)     |
| `LOG_NOCOLOR` | `1`                             | Disable colored log output           |

### Why Go?

Why not?

Go provides a number of practical benefits:

- **Compatible**: Easily builds across platforms and CPU architectures (Windows, Linux, MacOS, etc).
- **Fast**: Execution and build times are quick, and GoMud builds in just a couple of seconds.
- **Opinionated**: Consistent style/patterns make it easy to jump into any Go project.
- **Modern**: A relatively new language without decades of accumulated baggage.
- **Upgradable**: Strong backward compatibility makes version upgrades simple and low-risk.
- **Statically linked**: Built binaries have no dependency headaches.
- **No central registries**: Dependencies are pulled directly from source repositories.
- **Concurrent**: Concurrency is built into the language itself, not bolted on via external libraries.
