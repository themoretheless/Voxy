_vk-graph_ is a high-performance [Vulkan](https://www.vulkan.org/) driver for the Rust programming
language featuring automated resource management and execution. It is _blazingly_-fast, built for
real-world use, and supports modern Vulkan commands[^modern].

```toml
[dependencies]
vk-graph = "0.15"
```

Requires Rust 1.92 or newer.

## Overview

  <sub><a href="https://leartesstudios.com/1950s-nyc-megapack">1950s NYC</a> by Leartes using path-tracing; ~700 μs (<i>i7-11700K</i>)</sub>
</p>

_vk-graph_ supports desktop, mobile, and AR/VR platforms in headless, windowed, or full-screen
modes. An [accessory crate](crates/vk-graph-window/README.md) is provided for `winit` support:

```rust
use vk_graph_window::{Window, WindowError};

fn main() -> Result<(), WindowError> {
    Window::new()?.run(|frame| {
        // It's time to do some graphics! 😲
    })
}
```

<br>

## Usage

_vk-graph_ centers frame work around a `Graph`. Bind Vulkan smart-pointer resources such as buffers,
images, micromaps, acceleration structures, and swapchain images into the graph to get statically
typed node handles. Commands then reference those nodes instead of raw Vulkan handles. When
recording is complete, finalize the graph into a `Submission` and submit it with a pool.

The normal flow is:

- Create a `Device`, resources, and pipelines.
- Start a fresh `Graph` for the frame or workload.
- Bind resources into typed nodes with `Graph::bind_resource` or receive nodes from a swapchain
  integration crate.
- Record compute, graphics, transfer, or ray tracing commands with `Graph::begin_cmd`.
- Declare each resource access on the command so the graph can build synchronization and pass data.
- Finalize and submit the graph.

`CommandStream` is available when part of the command graph is reusable. A stream records commands
once with typed arguments, then each frame binds those arguments to the frame's concrete graph nodes.
This is useful for overlays, post-processing, or other repeated command sequences that still need
per-frame resources such as the current swapchain image.

Device extension support is exposed through the selected physical device:

```rust
if let Some(ray_tracing) = &device.physical.vk_khr_ray_tracing_pipeline {
    println!("max recursion depth: {}", ray_tracing.properties.max_ray_recursion_depth);
}

if device.physical.vk_khr_synchronization2 {
    println!("synchronization2 is available");
}
```

## Features

 - Compute, graphics, and ray tracing pipelines
 - Automatic Vulkan management (render passes, subpasses, descriptors, pools, _etc._)
 - Automatic render pass scheduling, re-ordering, merging, with resource aliasing
 - Interoperable with existing Vulkan code
 - Optional [shader hot-reload](crates/vk-graph-hot/README.md) from disk
 - Optional [nvidia-rs crates](https://github.com/attackgoat/nvidia#renderer-integrations): DLSS,
   denoising, additional SDKs

Example code:

```rust
graph
    .begin_cmd()
    .debug_name("Fancy new algorithm for shading a moving character who is actively on fire")
    .bind_pipeline(&gfx_pipeline)
    .shader_resource_access(0, prev_image, AccessType::FragmentShaderReadColorInputAttachment)
    .shader_resource_access(1, some_image, AccessType::FragmentShaderReadOther)
    .shader_resource_access(3, fire_buffer, AccessType::FragmentShaderReadUniformBuffer)
    .color_attachment_image(0, swapchain_image, LoadOp::CLEAR_BLACK_ALPHA_ZERO, StoreOp::Store)
    .depth_stencil_attachment_image(depth_image, LoadOp::Load, StoreOp::DontCare)
    .record_cmd(move |cmd| {
        cmd
            .push_constants(0, some_u8_slice)
            .draw(6, 1, 0, 0);
    });
```

## Optional features

_vk-graph_ puts a lot of functionality behind optional features in order to optimize
compile time for the most common use cases. The following features are
available.

- **`checked`** *(disabled by default)* — Runtime validation of common misuse patterns
  (missing access declarations, buffer bounds, image aspects) that the Vulkan Validation Layer
  cannot catch, including cross-graph node ownership checks. Enable explicitly with
  `vk-graph = { version = "0.15", features = ["checked"] }` during validation. It applies in both
  debug and release builds, independently of device debug mode or Vulkan validation layers.
- **`loaded`** *(enabled by default)* — Support searching for the Vulkan loader manually at runtime.
- **`linked`** — Link the Vulkan loader at compile time.
- **`ash-molten`** — Enable `ash-molten` support for MoltenVK-based platforms.
- **`parking_lot`** *(enabled by default)* — Use `parking_lot` synchronization primitives.
- **`profile-with-*`** — Use the specified profiling backend:
  `profile-with-puffin`, `profile-with-optick`, `profile-with-superluminal`, or
  `profile-with-tracy`

## Debug Logging

This crate uses [`log`](https://crates.io/crates/log) for low-overhead logging.

To enable logging, set the `RUST_LOG` environment variable to `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn` or
`error` and initialize the logging provider of your choice. Examples use
[`pretty_env_logger`](https://docs.rs/pretty_env_logger/latest/pretty_env_logger/).

_You may also filter messages, for example:_

```bash
RUST_LOG=vk_graph::driver=trace,vk_graph=warn cargo run --example ray_tracing
```

```
TRACE vk_graph::driver::instance > created a Vulkan instance
DEBUG vk_graph::driver::physical_device > physical device: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090
DEBUG vk_graph::driver::physical_device > extension "VK_KHR_16bit_storage" v1
DEBUG vk_graph::driver::physical_device > extension "VK_KHR_8bit_storage" v1
DEBUG vk_graph::driver::physical_device > extension "VK_KHR_acceleration_structure" v13
...
```

## Performance Profiling

This crate uses [`profiling`](https://crates.io/crates/profiling) and supports multiple profiling
providers. When not in use profiling has zero cost.

To enable profiling, compile with one of the `profile-with-*` features enabled and initialize the
profiling provider of your choice.

_Example code uses [puffin](https://crates.io/crates/puffin):_

```bash
cargo run --features profile-with-puffin --release --example vsm_omni
```

## Quick Start

Included are some examples you might find helpful:

- [`hello_world.rs`](crates/vk-graph-window/examples/hello_world.rs) — Displays a window on the
  screen. Please start here.
- [`triangle.rs`](examples/triangle.rs) — Shaders and full setup of index/vertex buffers; < 100 LOC.
- [`opacity_micromap.rs`](examples/opacity_micromap.rs) — Headless, synchronized construction of a
  two-state opacity micromap and attached BLAS; exits cleanly when unsupported.
- [`shader-toy/`](examples/shader-toy) — Recreation of a two-pass Shadertoy using the original
  shader code.

See the [example code](examples/README.md),
[documentation](https://docs.rs/vk-graph/latest/vk_graph/), or helpful
[guide book](https://attackgoat.github.io/vk-graph) for more information.
