## What is Estella?

Estella is a **2D/3D game engine** with a TypeScript SDK driven by a high-performance **C++** core — as WebAssembly on the web, and compiled ahead of time on native platforms. It outputs games that run in **web browsers**, on the **desktop**, in **WeChat MiniGames**, as single-file **playable ads**, and as native **Android / iOS** apps. A visual editor is available as a separate, free download.

## Why Estella?

- **Fast** — C++ rendering pipeline compiled to WebAssembly, not interpreted JS
- **Type-safe** — First-class TypeScript SDK with `defineSystem`, `defineComponent`, and `Query`
- **Data-oriented** — Entity-Component-System architecture for scalable game logic
- **Visual editor** — Scene hierarchy, inspector, asset browser — no JSON editing
- **Cross-platform** — One codebase, deploy to web, desktop, WeChat MiniGames, playable ads, and native mobile
- **Spine & Physics** — Built-in Spine animation and physics support
- **Agent-native** — The editor is an MCP server and ships an agent of its own; both drive the same tools its UI does

## Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Visual Editor** | Scene editor with hierarchy, inspector, and asset management |
| **ECS Architecture** | Compose entities from reusable components, drive behavior with systems |
| **WebGL / WebGPU Rendering** | Sprites, cameras, Spine animations, custom shaders — all in WebAssembly |
| **TypeScript SDK** | Type-safe API: `defineSystem`, `defineComponent`, `Query`, `Commands` |
| **Cross-Platform** | One project → web, desktop, WeChat MiniGames, playable ads, and native Android / iOS |
| **Native mobile** | A real arm64 app rendering through an embedded Dawn (Metal / Vulkan) — not a WebView |
| **AI agents** | The editor is an MCP server with 65 tools, and ships a built-in agent that drives the same ones |

## Getting Started

### Install

Download the editor for Windows or macOS from [estellaengine.com](https://estellaengine.com/#download)
— served from the project's mirror, always the newest release. Every build is also on the
[releases page](https://github.com/esengine/estella/releases).

### Create a Project

1. Open the editor and click **New Project**
2. Enter a project name, select a location, and click **Create**

The editor creates a project with a default scene containing a Camera entity.

### Write Game Logic

Add entities and components in the scene editor, then write systems in TypeScript:

```typescript
import {
    defineComponent, defineSystem, addSystem,
    Query, Mut, Res, Time, LocalTransform
} from 'esengine';

const Speed = defineComponent('Speed', { value: 200 });

addSystem(defineSystem(
    [Res(Time), Query(Mut(LocalTransform), Speed)],
    (time, query) => {
        for (const [entity, transform, speed] of query) {
            transform.position.x += speed.value * time.delta;
        }
    }
));
```

Press **F5** in the editor to preview.

## Let an agent build it

The editor speaks the **Model Context Protocol**. Point Claude Code, Cursor, or any
MCP-capable tool at it and the agent drives the real editor — opens projects, spawns
entities from the same Create menu you use, edits component fields, enters play mode,
takes a screenshot to *see* what it built, and exports the finished game. Sixty-five
tools, all of them the pipelines the UI itself calls.

It also ships an agent of its own, so you don't need an external tool to start: type a
sentence in the editor and watch every tool call it makes. Both front doors drive one
catalog — what the built-in agent can do and what your MCP client can do are the same
list, and both go through the editor's command surface, so creates are undoable and you
can take the mouse back mid-turn.

- [The Built-in Agent](https://estellaengine.com/docs/agents/built-in/) — set up a provider and start asking
- [External Agents (MCP)](https://estellaengine.com/docs/agents/mcp/) — connect Claude Code, Cursor, or your own

## License

This repository — the engine runtime, the SDK, the asset pipeline, the CLI, the
project templates and the editor plugin API — is licensed under the
[Apache License, Version 2.0](LICENSE).

You may use, modify, and distribute it **for any purpose, including commercial use**,
free of charge. There is no separate commercial license and no noncommercial
restriction. We follow [Semantic Versioning](VERSIONING.md) and keep a
[CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).

Three things to keep in mind:

- **The visual editor is a separate product** and is not open source. It is free to
  download and use, and it is built on this engine — but its source lives in a
  private repository rather than here. Everything needed to build, run and ship a
  game is in this repository: see [BUSINESS_MODEL.md](BUSINESS_MODEL.md) for what
  that boundary is and what changed.

- **Trademarks.** Apache-2.0 grants rights to the code, not to the "Estella" /
  "ESEngine" names or logos. You may state that your project uses Estella, but
  please don't imply endorsement or ship a fork under the Estella name.
- **Spine is separate.** The bundled [Spine Runtimes](third_party) are **not** open
  source. If you ship a game that uses Estella's Spine integration, you need a valid
  Spine license from Esoteric Software — independent of Estella's Apache-2.0 license.
  See [NOTICE](NOTICE).

How the project sustains itself (sponsorship, optional hosted/pro add-ons,
marketplace, and support) is described openly in [BUSINESS_MODEL.md](BUSINESS_MODEL.md).
