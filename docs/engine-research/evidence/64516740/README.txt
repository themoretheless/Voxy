## Why Doriax?

Doriax is for developers who want a smaller, native, code-transparent engine without giving up a visual editor. It combines scene authoring, scripting, shader tooling, builds, and exports in one open-source workflow.

- **Lightweight** — a lean, data-oriented runtime that keeps abstractions and engine overhead under control
- **Native C++** — native platform and graphics backends, with C++ available throughout the stack
- **Lua and C++ together** — prototype quickly in Lua, write native gameplay code in C++, or mix both
- **Visual workflow** — edit 2D, 3D, and UI scenes with a hierarchy, inspector, resources, animation timeline, and play mode
- **ECS and data-oriented** — shared 2D/3D runtime designed around cache-friendly component data
- **Open and hackable** — MIT-licensed engine code and readable exported projects, with no closed build pipeline
- **Cross-platform** — target Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, iOS, and HTML5

## Native projects you control

**Source Code** export produces a standalone CMake project containing generated C++ scene and bundle code, your Lua and C++ scripts, assets, platform backends, compiled shaders, and the engine source it needs.

Export converts `.scene` and `.bundle` authoring data into C++ factory functions that call the public engine API, and compiles your C++ scripts unchanged alongside them, so scene setup runs as compiled code with no editor file format left to parse at runtime. Lua scripts, textures, models, and audio stay runtime resources. See the [export guide](https://docs.doriax.org/editor/export/#from-editor-data-to-runtime-code) for the generated output structure and asset filtering.

The exported project is yours: inspect the result, add native integrations, change the engine, and compile the game yourself outside the editor with standard native toolchains.

When you want a finished artifact instead, use **Desktop** export to build a ready-to-run native binary for the current computer, or **Web** export to build HTML and WebAssembly with Emscripten.

## Editor workflow

- Build 2D and 3D scenes with sprites, tilemaps, models, cameras, lights, and reusable entities
- Edit component properties, project resources, animations, bones, and terrain without leaving the editor
- Write Lua and C++ in the integrated code editor with engine API completion
- Fork the built-in Mesh (color and depth), UI, Points, Lines, and Sky shaders, plus custom shaders for ordered post-process passes, with live viewport recompilation and custom uniforms editable in the editor or set from scripts
- Run the game in play mode, inspect build output, and export scenes, assets, scripts, engine files, and compiled shaders
- Optionally call on the built-in AI assistant to inspect the project, create entities, draft Lua and C++ scripts, and invoke builds, with preview-then-approve, auto-run-read-only, and full-agent modes deciding how much it may do on its own

## Platform support

| Area | Support |
| --- | --- |
| Editor | Windows, Linux, macOS |
| Export targets | Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, iOS, HTML5 |
| Rendering backends | OpenGL/OpenGL ES, Vulkan, Metal, Direct3D 11 |
| Scripting | Lua, C++ |

Backend availability depends on the target platform. OpenGL is the default editor backend on Windows and Linux, while macOS uses Metal; Vulkan can be selected on Windows or Linux at configure time.

## Get started

Download the latest tagged release from the [Doriax website](https://doriax.org/#download) or the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/doriaxengine/doriax/releases), then follow [Your First Project](https://docs.doriax.org/getting-started/first-project/) to create a scene, attach a script, and run it in the editor.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Tagged release:** recommended for projects. **`main` build:** the newest development version, which may contain regressions, incomplete work, or breaking changes.

### Build from source

All platforms require:

- A C++17 compiler: MSVC, GCC, or Clang
- CMake 3.27 or newer (required by the bundled shader compiler)
- Python 3

Clone the repository before following the instructions for your platform:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/doriaxengine/doriax.git
cd doriax
```

#### Linux (Ubuntu 26.04)

Ubuntu 26.04 includes a recent enough CMake in its official repositories, so no third-party package source is required:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
  build-essential cmake git ninja-build pkg-config python3 \
  libx11-dev libxcursor-dev libxi-dev libxrandr-dev \
  libgl1-mesa-dev libwayland-dev wayland-protocols \
  libdbus-1-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev

cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build --target doriax-editor
./build/doriax-editor
```

To create a redistributable install tree under `dist/`:

```bash
cmake --install build --prefix dist
```

#### macOS

Install the Xcode Command Line Tools, CMake, and Ninja:

```bash
xcode-select --install
brew install cmake ninja

cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build --target doriax-editor
open build/Doriax.app
```

To create a redistributable app under `dist/bin/`:

```bash
cmake --install build --prefix dist
```

#### Windows (Visual Studio)

The official Windows download is built with MSVC. C++ scripts played inside that editor must use an MSVC-compatible toolchain with the same architecture; MSYS2 GCC cannot link against its engine library. In **Project Settings > Build**, select an available compatible compiler or **Default**, which resolves to a compatible toolchain. See [Building for Windows](https://docs.doriax.org/building/windows/) for setup details. Lua-only projects can play inside the editor without a C++ compiler; exporting a project still requires build tools.

Install Python 3 and Visual Studio 2022 or newer with the **Desktop development with C++** workload and **C++ CMake tools for Windows** component. Run these commands from a Developer PowerShell or Developer Command Prompt:

```powershell
cmake -S . -B build -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64
cmake --build build --config Release --target doriax-editor doriax-editor-cmd
build\Release\doriax-editor.exe
```

If you use Visual Studio 2026, replace the generator with `"Visual Studio 18 2026"`. The explicit `doriax-editor-cmd` target is required because the console executable is excluded from the default build.

To install the editor, CLI executable, runtime library, and engine files under `dist/bin/`:

```powershell
cmake --install build --prefix dist --config Release
```

#### Windows (MSYS2 UCRT64, source build)

There is no separate UCRT64 release package. To use GCC for C++ Play, build the editor and engine with the same UCRT64 toolchain used for your scripts. UCRT64 GCC and MSVC C++ binaries are incompatible. Keep the editor, engine DLL, and import library from the same build together.

Install [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/), update it with `pacman -Syu` (reopen the terminal and repeat if requested), then run the following in the **MSYS2 UCRT64** terminal from the repository directory:

```bash
pacman -S --needed git mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-toolchain \
  mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-cmake mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-ninja \
  mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-python

cmake -S . -B build-ucrt64 -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++
cmake --build build-ucrt64 --target doriax-editor doriax-editor-cmd
./build-ucrt64/doriax-editor.exe
```

Launch the editor from that terminal so it can find the UCRT64 compiler, `mingw32-make` (included in the toolchain package), and runtime DLLs. Select the UCRT64 GCC kit in **Project Settings > Build**. The editor's own Ninja build and the generated scripts' MinGW Makefiles build can use different generators while sharing the same compiler.

To validate a source build, create a project with a C++ script, press Play, stop, edit the script, and press Play again. Confirm that compilation, linking, and plugin loading succeed. The existing MinGW CI job is not a dedicated UCRT64 Play test, so this source-build path still needs validation on Windows. If an older project retains the previous compiler configuration, close the editor and remove only the project's `.doriax/build` directory before retrying.

#### Optional Vulkan editor

The editor defaults to OpenGL on Windows and Linux and to Metal on macOS. To use Vulkan on Windows or Linux, install the Vulkan SDK and add `-DGRAPHIC_BACKEND=vulkan` to that platform's configure command. A separate build directory lets you keep both backends configured:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build-vulkan -G Ninja \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DGRAPHIC_BACKEND=vulkan
cmake --build build-vulkan --target doriax-editor
```

The example above uses the Linux Ninja toolchain. On Windows, add `-DGRAPHIC_BACKEND=vulkan` to the Visual Studio configure command instead.

## Command-line tools

The editor executable also exposes automation commands for project export and standalone shader generation:

```bash
doriax-editor export --help
doriax-editor shaders --help
```

Windows release packages use `doriax-editor-cmd.exe` for console automation; the Windows build instructions above create it alongside the GUI editor.

## Project history and development

Doriax started in 2015 as Supernova Engine, a code-first game-development API. Public development began with the [initial commit in July 2016](https://github.com/doriaxengine/doriax/commit/88561113), and the full history is in this repository. The visual editor started in 2024 in a [separate editor repository](https://github.com/eduardodoria/doriax-editor), then named `supernova-editor`, after building complete projects with code alone proved impractical.

The architecture, technical direction, and engineering decisions are made by the maintainer. Over the past year, AI coding tools have been used for bounded work: repetitive implementation, investigation, documentation, and review. The maintainer reviews and adapts what those tools produce.

This is separate from Doriax's optional built-in AI assistant, which is an editor feature users choose to enable.

Version `0.5.5` was the final release under the Supernova name, and `0.6` is the first Doriax release. Some internal folders and older external references may still use the Supernova name while the transition continues.
