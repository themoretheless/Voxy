## Overview

Synapse Engine is a research-oriented real-time rendering engine focusing on eliminating CPU bottlenecks and maximizing GPU utilization through a fully compute-driven pipeline. 

The system integrates a segmented data-oriented ECS with a hierarchical GPU culling architecture, modern mesh shader support, and an advanced virtualized shadow map system for directional, spot, and point lights (supporting both CPU and GPU-driven paths). The engine now utilizes an MVI architecture for its tooling and features a robust cross-platform build system using `xmake` for Windows and Linux.

## Core Concepts

* **GPU-driven rendering**: Indirect draw and compute-based visibility.
* **Hierarchical culling in Compute Shaders**: CPU-generated static chunks and GPU-generated Morton chunks, executing a Chunk → Model → Mesh pipeline, followed by Task Shader Meshlet culling.
* **Template-based Custom ECS Registry**: Natively handles static, dynamic, and stream entities per component with O(1) access.
* **Full Bindless Vulkan**: Utilizing a bindless architecture and the most modern Vulkan extensions.
* **Hybrid Pipeline**: Simultaneous support for traditional and modern Mesh Shader rendering paths.
* **Lighting & Materials**: PBR rendering with an advanced, virtualized shadow map simulation.

## Visual Demonstration

## Lighting Architectures

### Forward+ Rendering

The engine implements an advanced Forward+ rendering path featuring dynamic, Hi-Z based variable tile sizing. Tiles are dynamically split into clusters based on depth information to optimize light culling.

### Deferred Rendering

Deferred rendering is fully supported alongside the Forward+ pipeline. Light volumes are accurately represented during the lighting pass.

## Virtualized Shadow Mapping

Synapse Engine employs a fully virtualized shadow map architecture backed by a unified 4K texture atlas. Shadows can be toggled between CPU-driven and full GPU-driven pipelines at runtime. All geometries belonging to a specific light are batch-rendered efficiently.

### Directional Lights (Cascades)
Directional light shadow cascades are allocated directly into the main atlas. The pipeline utilizes the full Chunk → Model → Mesh → Meshlet culling hierarchy to only render the necessary shadow casters into the cascade regions.

![Directional Light Atlas](Docs/Images/DirLightAtlas.png)
![Directional Light Simulation](Docs/Images/DirLightShadow.png)

### Point Lights (Omnidirectional)
Omnidirectional shadows are mapped by allocating 3x2 chunks for the cube faces and projecting them flattened into the virtual 4K shadow map. This drastically reduces the overhead of traditional cubemap rendering.

![Point Light Atlas](Docs/Images/PointLightAtlas.png)
![Point Light Simulation](Docs/Images/PointLightShadow.png)

### Spot Lights
Similar to the other light types, each spot light manages its own localized atlas region within the virtualized shadow map.

## Hierarchical Culling

The engine utilizes a multi-stage culling approach to ensure minimal waste of GPU resources. **The culling pipeline can be dynamically switched between CPU-driven and full GPU-driven modes at runtime.**

### Chunk Culling
The macro-level culling operates on spatial chunks. Static entities are grouped into CPU-generated chunks, while dynamic entities utilize GPU-generated Morton chunks. 

![Chunk Culling Debug](Docs/Images/ChunkDebug.png)
*Visualization of active spatial chunks.*

### Model, Mesh, and Meshlet Culling
Culling is executed in highly parallel compute shaders. Passing entities trigger indirect draw dispatches.
* **Model Culling:** Coarse filtering of entire objects.
* **Mesh Culling:** Finer filtering at the sub-mesh level.
* **Meshlet Culling:** Executed in the Task Shader for the ultimate granular visibility check.

### Frustum, Occlusion & Cone Culling

* **Frustum Culling:** Geometry completely outside the camera's view is discarded before reaching the rasterizer.
![Frustum Culling](Docs/Images/Frustum.png)

* **Occlusion Culling:** Objects hidden behind other opaque structures are efficiently culled using Hi-Z occlusion tests, drastically reducing overdraw.
![Occlusion Culling Rendering](Docs/Images/Occlusion.png)

* **Cone Culling:** Back-facing meshlets and geometry clusters are efficiently rejected early in the pipeline using normal cone tests, further reducing the number of processed primitives.

### Visual Debug Tools

The engine features comprehensive visual debugging capabilities to inspect the internal state of the scene and the rendering pipeline in real-time. This includes the ability to toggle wireframe rendering down to the granular meshlet level, as well as visualizing various bounding volumes and colliders.

## Build

We use **xmake** for seamless cross-platform building on Windows and Linux.

> Unless stated otherwise, all `xmake` commands should be executed from the `SynapseEngine` directory (the repository root), where the `xmake.lua` file is located.

---

### Windows Setup

#### 1. Install Xmake

You can install **xmake** using PowerShell via **winget** or **Chocolatey**.

```powershell
winget install xmake

# or

choco install xmake
```

#### 2. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository along with its submodules.

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/TamasPetii/SynapseEngine.git
```

If the repository has already been cloned, initialize or update the submodules:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

#### 3. Bootstrap vcpkg

```powershell
cd External/vcpkg
.\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
cd ..\..
cd SynapseEngine/
```

---

### IDE Integration (Windows)

#### Visual Studio Code

Install the **Xmake** extension for Visual Studio Code.

The extension provides:

- Xmake Explorer
- Target Editor
- Build Mode selector (Debug / Release / Dist / Performance)
- Build & Run buttons

![Xmake Visual Studio Code](Docs/Images/XmakeVsCode.png)

#### Visual Studio 2026 (.sln)

Generate a native Visual Studio solution:

```bash
xmake project -k vsxmake -m "debug,release,dist,performance" .
```

#### CMake + Visual Studio 2026

Generate a `CMakeLists.txt` for traditional CMake workflows:

```bash
xmake project -k cmake -m "debug,release,dist,performance" .
```

#### CLion

SynapseEngine integrates perfectly with CLion using the official Xmake plugin.

1. **Install the Plugin:** Open CLion, navigate to Settings > Plugins, search for **Xmake**, and install it from the marketplace.
2. **Xmake Tool Window:** After opening the project, you will find the Xmake tool window situated in the bottom-left corner of the IDE. You can use this panel to manage the project, select your build targets, switch build modes, and compile the engine directly.

![CLion Xmake Tool Window](Docs/Images/ClionXmakePlugin.png)
*The Xmake tool window located at the bottom left for building the project.*

3. **Run & Debug Configurations:** While the plugin seamlessly handles the build process, the launch and debug options must be configured manually. Go to the **Run/Debug Configurations** menu, create a new configuration, and manually set the executable path pointing to the binary compiled by xmake.

### Linux Setup (Ubuntu)

> **Important**
>
> SynapseEngine requires **GCC 14**. Both **vcpkg** and the engine **must** be built using the exact same compiler (`gcc-14` / `g++-14`) to guarantee ABI compatibility and consistent standard library behavior.

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install -y \
    gcc-14 \
    g++-14 \
    build-essential \
    pkg-config \
    autoconf \
    autoconf-archive \
    automake \
    libtool \
    m4 \

curl -fsSL https://xmake.io/shget.text | bash

source ~/.xmake/profile
```

#### 3. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/TamasPetii/SynapseEngine.git

cd SynapseEngine
```

#### 4. Configure the Compiler

Ensure that **both vcpkg and SynapseEngine use GCC 14**.

```bash
export CC=gcc-14
export CXX=g++-14
```

#### 5. Bootstrap vcpkg

```bash
cd External/vcpkg

./bootstrap-vcpkg.sh

cd ../..
```

#### 6. Configure & Build

Configure the project using the GCC 14 toolchain and build it.

```bash
cd SynapseEngine

xmake f -p linux -a x64 -m release --cc=gcc-14 --cxx=g++-14 -y

xmake
```

> The **Visual Studio Code Xmake extension** works on Linux exactly the same way as on Windows, providing a seamless graphical workflow for configuring, building, and running the engine.
