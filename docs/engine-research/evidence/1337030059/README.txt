**Hermes3D** is a _3D virtual office for AI agents_ you run on your own infrastructure.
Instead of watching automation through dashboards and logs, you walk through a live 3D office where your agents collaborate, review code, run standups, ship pull requests, and execute tasks side by side. The Gateway is just the control plane — the product is the office.

If you want a personal, self-hosted workspace that turns your AI workforce into something you can actually _see_, this is it.

Supported runtimes include: Hermes through the bundled gateway adapter, a direct HTTP `custom` runtime provider for orchestrator-backed stacks, and a built-in demo gateway for office exploration without a real agent framework.

> **Unofficial project.** Hermes3D is an independent, community-driven frontend. It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or maintained by the teams behind the agent backends it connects to.

Built and maintained by **LukeTheDev**. Follow on X: [@iamlukethedev](https://x.com/iamlukethedev).

## What you can do with Hermes3D

- **Watch your AI agents work in real time** inside a shared 3D office.
- **Switch to the 2D pixel office** — a Gather-style pixel-art view of the same live agents for low-power machines (Settings → Office renderer, or the `2D` button in the office toolbar).
- **Run standups** with agents connected to GitHub and Jira.
- **Review pull requests** from inside the office.
- **Monitor QA pipelines** and logs without leaving the workspace.
- **Train agents in the gym** to develop new skills.
- **Reset sessions and clean context** with the janitor system.

## What Hermes3D Is

Hermes3D is the visualization and interaction layer.

Today it can sit on top of:

- Hermes through the bundled WebSocket gateway adapter
- a direct HTTP `custom` runtime provider for orchestrator-backed stacks
- a built-in demo gateway for office exploration without a real agent framework

In practical terms, this app gives you:

- a live `/office` retro-office environment where agents appear as workers moving through a shared 3D world
- an `/office/builder` surface for editing and publishing office layouts
- a gateway-first architecture that keeps runtime state in the connected backend while Studio stores local UI preferences
- a backend-neutral runtime seam inside Studio so additional providers can be integrated without rewriting the whole UI

This repository does not build the upstream runtimes themselves. It is the frontend, Studio, and adapter/proxy layer that connects to a runtime speaking the Hermes3D gateway protocol.

## Why It Exists

AI systems are becoming more capable, but their work is still usually hidden behind logs, terminal output, and dashboards.

Hermes3D exists to make agent systems visible:

- inspect what agents are doing in real time
- monitor runs, approvals, history, and activity from one place
- interact with agents through chat and immersive UI surfaces
- move toward a world where AI systems are understandable through space, motion, and presence

For the broader direction of the project, see [`VISION.md`](VISION.md).

## What Exists Today

The current app already includes a substantial Hermes3D surface:

- Fleet management and agent chat with runtime updates streamed from the gateway.
- Agent creation, settings, session controls, approvals, and gateway-backed configuration editing.
- A 3D retro office with desks, rooms, navigation, animations, and event-driven activity cues.
- Immersive operational spaces for standups, GitHub review flows, analytics, and system monitoring.
- Local Studio persistence for gateway connection details, focused-agent preferences, desk assignments, office state, and related UI settings.
- A custom same-origin WebSocket proxy so the browser talks to Studio, and Studio talks to the upstream gateway.

## Quick Start

Requirements:

- Node.js 20+ recommended.
- npm 10+ recommended.
- One of:
  - a running Hermes API server plus the bundled gateway adapter
  - the built-in demo gateway for local exploration

Prerequisite:

- Hermes3D does not install or build Hermes for you.
- Before starting Hermes3D against a real backend, make sure your chosen runtime is already running and that you know the gateway URL and token Studio should use.
- For a no-framework local office demo, run the bundled demo gateway instead.
- If you need a full cross-machine setup guide (Hermes + Tailscale + Hermes3D), follow [`TUTORIAL.md`](TUTORIAL.md).
- To connect to a remote `hermes-agent` backend with no adapter process, follow [`docs/hermes-agent-tailscale.md`](docs/hermes-agent-tailscale.md).
- To make the office react to chats you have elsewhere (desktop app, TUI, CLI), install the optional bridge plugin in [`docs/office-conversation-bridge.md`](docs/office-conversation-bridge.md).

Run from source:

```bash
git clone <your-public-repo-url> hermes3d
cd hermes3d
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm run dev
```

Then open `http://localhost:3000` and configure the gateway URL and token in Studio.
Studio now also persists the selected backend mode (`Hermes`, `Demo`, `Local`, `Hermes3D`, or `Custom`) and
shows the active backend reported by the connected gateway.

### Runtime profiles

If you are integrating an orchestrator-backed runtime through the direct
HTTP runtime seam, start your runtime first, then start Hermes3D:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open `http://localhost:3000`, choose `Local runtime`, `Hermes3D runtime`,
or `Custom backend`, and point the upstream URL at your runtime boundary.
Typical examples:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:7770
```

```text
http://localhost:3000/api/runtime/custom
```

Current direct-runtime expectations:

- `GET /health`
- `GET /state`
- `GET /registry`
- `POST /v1/chat/completions`

The browser does not call that runtime directly. Hermes3D proxies the
`custom` provider through its own same-origin route at
`/api/runtime/custom`, which avoids browser-side CORS problems and keeps
the provider transport separate from the Hermes gateway path.

### Hermes adapter

Hermes is the default backend. It is reached through the bundled gateway
adapter, which speaks the Hermes3D gateway WebSocket protocol on one side
and the Hermes HTTP API (`http://localhost:8642` by default) on the other:

```bash
npm run hermes-adapter
npm run dev
```

See [`docs/hermes-gateway.md`](docs/hermes-gateway.md) for setup details and current scope.

For a local gateway on the same machine, the usual upstream URL is:

```text
ws://localhost:18789
```

In the connect screen, choose `Hermes backend`, then connect.

### Demo mode

If you only want to see the office and agent interactions without installing Hermes:

```bash
npm run demo-gateway
npm run dev
```

Then connect Studio to:

```text
ws://localhost:18789
```

This starts a mock local gateway with demo agents, streaming chat, session previews, and office presence.
In the connect screen, choose `Demo backend`, then connect.

## How It Connects

Hermes3D uses two separate network hops:

1. Browser -> Studio over HTTP and a same-origin WebSocket at `/api/gateway/ws`.
2. Studio -> the gateway over a second WebSocket opened by the Studio server.

That means `ws://localhost:18789` always refers to the gateway reachable from the Studio host, not necessarily from the browser device.

This design keeps gateway settings persisted on the Studio host and lets Studio open the upstream connection server-side. The current UI still loads the configured upstream URL/token into browser memory at runtime, so treat the browser as part of the active trust boundary.

## Common Setups

### Gateway local, Studio local

1. Start Studio with `npm run dev`.
2. Open `http://localhost:3000`.
3. Use `ws://localhost:18789` plus your gateway token.

### Gateway remote, Studio local

Use any gateway URL your machine can reach.

Recommended with Tailscale:

1. On the gateway host, run `tailscale serve --yes --bg --https 443 http://127.0.0.1:18789`.
2. In Studio, use `wss://<gateway-host>.ts.net`.

Alternative with SSH:

1. Run `ssh -L 18789:127.0.0.1:18789 user@<gateway-host>`.
2. In Studio, use `ws://localhost:18789`.

### Studio remote, Gateway remote

1. Run Studio on the remote host.
2. Expose Studio on a private network or over Tailscale.
3. Set `STUDIO_ACCESS_TOKEN` if Studio binds to a public host.
4. Configure the gateway URL and token inside Studio.

### Studio on LAN or Tailscale for other devices

1. Start Studio with `HOST=0.0.0.0` (or a specific LAN/Tailscale host).
2. Set `STUDIO_ACCESS_TOKEN` before exposing Studio beyond localhost.
3. Open Hermes3D from the LAN/Tailscale address instead of `localhost`.
4. If you are connecting to a remote gateway, make sure that gateway accepts connections from the Studio host and that the token you configured is the one it expects.

## Tech Stack

- Next.js App Router, React, and TypeScript for the main web application.
- A custom Node server for the Studio-side WebSocket proxy.
- Three.js, React Three Fiber, and Drei for the 3D office experience.
- Phaser for the 2D pixel office, office/viewer-builder workflows, and related interactive surfaces.
- Vitest for unit tests and Playwright for end-to-end coverage.

## Configuration

Important runtime paths:

- Hermes config: `~/.hermes/hermes.json`
- Studio settings: `~/.hermes/hermes3d/settings.json`

Common environment variables:

- `HOST` and `PORT` control the Studio server bind address and port.
- `STUDIO_ACCESS_TOKEN` protects Studio when binding to a public host.
- `UPSTREAM_ALLOWLIST` restricts which upstream gateway hosts Studio may proxy to. Set this in production.
- `CUSTOM_RUNTIME_ALLOWLIST` restricts which hosts `/api/runtime/custom` may fetch. If unset, it falls back to `UPSTREAM_ALLOWLIST`.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_GATEWAY_URL` provides the default upstream gateway URL when Studio settings are empty. **Note:** this is a build-time variable — changes require `npm run build` to take effect.
- `HERMES3D_GATEWAY_URL` and `HERMES3D_GATEWAY_TOKEN` provide a runtime alternative to `NEXT_PUBLIC_GATEWAY_URL` that takes effect on server restart without a rebuild.
- `HERMES3D_GATEWAY_ADAPTER_TYPE` can pair with `HERMES3D_GATEWAY_URL` to mark those runtime defaults as `hermes`, `demo`, `local`, `hermes3d`, or `custom`.
- If `HERMES3D_GATEWAY_URL` is not set, Studio can still surface local Hermes or demo adapter defaults from `HERMES_ADAPTER_PORT` / `DEMO_ADAPTER_PORT`.
- `HERMES_API_URL` points the gateway adapter at the Hermes HTTP API. It defaults to `http://localhost:8642`.
- Hermes file defaults come from `~/.hermes/hermes.json` when present.
- `HERMES_STATE_DIR` and `HERMES_CONFIG_PATH` override the default Hermes paths.
- `HERMES_GATEWAY_SSH_TARGET`, `HERMES_GATEWAY_SSH_USER`, `HERMES_GATEWAY_SSH_PORT`, and `HERMES_GATEWAY_SSH_STRICT_HOST_KEY_CHECKING` support advanced gateway-host operations over SSH when needed.
- `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`, `ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID`, and `ELEVENLABS_MODEL_ID` enable voice reply integration.

## Current Limitations

- The immersive retro office (`/office`) and the Phaser builder (`/office/builder`) are related but still separate stacks.
- The app keeps gateway secrets out of browser persistent storage, but the current connection flow still loads the upstream URL/token into browser memory at runtime.
- Voice transcription is not bundled. `/api/office/voice/transcribe` returns `501 Not Implemented`, so voice notes must be transcribed by an external provider before they reach the office.
- Local Spotify auth for `SOUNDHERMES` currently stores an access token only. Refresh-token handling is not implemented yet, so local Spotify auth may need to be repeated after the token expires.

## Troubleshooting

If the UI loads but Connect fails, the problem is usually on the Studio -> Gateway side:

- Confirm the upstream URL and token in Studio settings.
- `EPROTO` or `wrong version number` usually means `wss://` was used against a non-TLS endpoint.
- `INVALID_REQUEST` errors mentioning `minProtocol` or `maxProtocol` usually mean the gateway is too old for Hermes3D protocol v3. Update the gateway you are connecting to, run the bundled Hermes adapter, or run `npm run demo-gateway`.
- `401 Studio access token required` usually means `STUDIO_ACCESS_TOKEN` is enabled and the request is missing the expected `studio_access` cookie.
- If `/api/runtime/custom` returns a blocked-host error in production, set `CUSTOM_RUNTIME_ALLOWLIST` or include the runtime host in `UPSTREAM_ALLOWLIST`.
- Helpful proxy error codes include `studio.gateway_url_missing`, `studio.gateway_token_missing`, `studio.upstream_error`, and `studio.upstream_closed`.

Marketplace skill installs now use a gateway-native workspace flow and do not require enabling SSH on the user machine.

### Spotify auth on localhost

If you are testing the `SOUNDHERMES` jukebox locally and Spotify OAuth does not accept your `localhost` callback, use an `ngrok` callback bridge:

1. Keep Hermes3D running locally on `http://localhost:3000`.
2. Start `ngrok` for the local Studio server, for example `ngrok http 3000`.
3. In the jukebox setup UI, paste your public `ngrok` URL into the `ngrok Public URL` field.
4. In the Spotify developer dashboard, register `https://<your-ngrok-host>/spotify/callback` as the redirect URI.
5. Complete Spotify sign-in from the jukebox panel.

How it works:

- The main Hermes3D app stays on `localhost`, so your normal local office state and agent state remain intact.
- Spotify redirects to the `ngrok` callback URL.
- The callback page passes the auth code back to the open local Hermes3D window.

Current local limitation:

- Because only the Spotify access token is stored right now, you may need to repeat the `ngrok` auth flow when that token expires during local development.

If you use other advanced gateway-host operations over SSH:

- macOS: enable `System Settings` -> `General` -> `Sharing` -> `Remote Login`, and make sure the target user is allowed.
- Windows: enable the `OpenSSH Server` optional feature, start the `sshd` service, and allow it through the firewall.
- Linux: make sure `sshd` is installed, running, and reachable from the Studio machine.

For first-time SSH connections, Hermes3D uses `StrictHostKeyChecking=accept-new` by default so a new host key can be trusted automatically. If you need stricter behavior, set `HERMES_GATEWAY_SSH_STRICT_HOST_KEY_CHECKING=yes`, or set it to `no` only if you explicitly want to skip host key checks.
