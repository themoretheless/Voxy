## About

Hyperion started as a passion project, back in 2016, and is still worked on daily. Our aim with Hyperion is to offer a high fidelity gaming experience even on low-end hardware using our in-house baking system to prepare as much of the lighting and effects as possible ahead of time.

| Baked lightmaps and reflections | Multiplayer, in play-in-editor mode |

## Some Features
- Clustered deferred shading supporting a large number of dynamic lights while maintaining good frame times. Uses forward clustered shading for translucent materials.
- Visual editor on Windows and macOS, built with Avalonia.
- Offline lightmapper integrated into the editor. Bake lightmaps into the scene,  reflection/irradiance probes for dynamic objects, fog volumes, and other static lighting data such as shadow maps.
- Real time global illumination and reflections via Ray tracing and screen-space options for non-RT capable hardware.
- Shader compiler system with built in permutations support, and live reload in editor to see changes as you make them.
- Scripting via the [Strata programming language](https://github.com/StrataLanguage/stratac) - JIT compiled, live reload in editor, or AOT linking with shipping builds
- Level streaming via grid-based streaming
- Basic multiplayer setup, with a dedicated server, client-side prediction, replication, etc

## Platforms
Currently, we are focusing our efforts on developing the engine for *Windows*, *macOS*, *Android*, *iOS*, and Steam Deck via Proton. Editor support is available on Windows and macOS. Linux support is planned.

## Getting started
Documentation is a WIP but we have some available on our site: [Documentation](https://hyperionengine.dev/docs)

## AI
AI can a useful tool, but intention is important when building something super complex like a game engine. We aim to keep the usage of AI-generated code limited to bug fixes, UI changes, and occasionally, prototyping / boilerplate. In an effort to maintain transparency, we aim to note where AI is used generally as part of a commit message, comment on the commit on GitHub, or on the PR; although this is on a best effort basis. 

We expect contributors to be honest and upfront about the usage of AI generated code and while AI-generated code isn’t de facto unacceptable, the code must pass the same quality bar that human generated code would.
