<p align="center">
  Origo is a Linux only 3D game engine written in C++23 and modern OpenGL.
</p>

## Design Choices and Goals

Origo is not intended to compete with established engines such as Unity or Godot.
It is a learning project developed for submission to the CV-Tag 2026 at the University of Koblenz.

## Requirements

- **OS:** Linux  
  Developed and tested on Arch Linux

- **Compiler:** GCC with C++23 support

- **Graphics:** OpenGL  
  Proper driver support required (Mesa recommended)

- **Build system:** CMake + Ninja

## Clone and Build

The repository vendors its third-party dependencies directly, so a normal clone is enough:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SalarAlo/origo.git
```

Then configure and build the project:

```bash
cmake -B ./build
cmake --build ./build
```

Tests are optional and disabled by default so a normal configure works without
network access. Enable them explicitly with `-DORIGO_ENABLE_TESTS=ON`.
