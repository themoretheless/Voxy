## Overview
NetAF is a simple, lightweight library for building text based adventures.

![NetAF_example](https://github.com/benpollarduk/adventure-framework/assets/129943363/20656e76-4e80-475e-aa73-93976d98c5c9)

At its core NetAF provides simple classes for developing and controlling the flow of games.

### Environments
Environments are broken down into three elements - Overworld, Region and Room. An Overworld contains one or more Regions. A Region contains one or more Rooms. 
A Room can contain up to six exits (north, south, east, west, up and down).

```
Overworld
├── Region
│   ├── Room
│   ├── Room
│   ├── Room
├── Region
│   ├── Room
│   ├── Room
```

### Exits
Rooms contain exits. Exits can be locked to block progress through the game.

```csharp
var room = new Room("Test Room", "A test room.", [new Exit(Direction.North)]);
```

### Items
Items add richness to a game. Items support interaction with the player, rooms, other items and NPC's. Items can morph in to other items. 
For example, using item A on item B may cause item B to morph into item C.

```csharp
var sword = new Item("Sword", "The heroes sword.");
```

### Playable Character
Each NetAF game has at least one playable character. The game is played through the view point of a playable character.

```csharp
var player = new PlayableCharacter("Dave", "The hero of the story.");
```

### Non-playable Characters
Non-playable characters (NPC's) can be added to rooms and can help drive the narrative. NPC's can hold conversations, contains items, 
and interact with items.

```csharp
var npc = new NonPlayableCharacter("Gary", "The antagonist of the story.");
```
  
### Commands
NetAF provides commands for interacting with game elements:
  * **Drop X** - drop an item, where X is the item.
  * **Examine X** - allows items, characters and environments to be examined.
  * **Take X** - take an item, where X is the item.
  * **Talk to X** - talk to a NPC, where X is the NPC.
  * **Use X on Y** - use an item. Items can be used on a variety of targets. Where X is the item and Y is the target.
  * **N, S, E, W, U, D** - traverse through the rooms in a region.

NetAF also provides global commands to help with game flow and option management:
  * **About** - display version information.
  * **Exit** - exit the game.
  * **Help X** - display the help screen for a command, where X is the command.
  * **History** - display in-game history.
  * **Notes** - display any gathered in-game notes.
  * **Commands** - display the command list.
  * **Option** - adjust options.
  * **Map** - display the map.
  * **New** - start a new game.

Custom commands can be added to games without the need to extend the existing interpretation.

### Interpretation
NetAF provides classes for handling interpretation of input. Interpretation is extensible with the ability for custom interpreters to be added outside of the core NetAF library.

### Conversations
Conversations can be held between the player and a NPC. Conversations support multiple lines of dialogue and responses.

### Attributes
All game assets support customisable attributes. This provides the possibility to build systems within a game, for example adding currency and trading, adding HP to enemies, MP to your character, durability to Items etc.

### Rendering
NetAF provides frames for rendering the various game screens. These are fully extensible and customisable. These include:
   * **Scene frame** - for displaying scenes in the game.
   * **Help frame** - for displaying in-game help for a specific command.
   * **Map frame** - for displaying the map.
   * **Title frame** - for displaying the title screen.
   * **Completion frame** - for displaying game complete.
   * **Game over frame** - for displaying game over.
   * **Conversation frame** - for displaying a conversation.
   * **Visual frame** - for displaying a visual.
   * **Command list frame** - for displaying a list of commands.
   * **Note frame** - for displaying any in-game notes.
   * **History frame** - for displaying in-game history.
   * **Narrative frame** - for displaying a section of narrative.

#### Visuals
Although NetAF is primarily focused on text and interactive fiction, there are times where adding a visual can enrich the game.

For more information see the [Visuals](https://benpollarduk.github.io/NetAF-docs/docs/visuals.html) topic.

The [NetAF.Imaging](https://github.com/benpollarduk/NetAF.Imaging) extension package can be used to extend the basic NetAF visual functions to allow conversion of images to visuals that can be displayed in a game.

#### NO_COLOR
NetAF supports the [NO_COLOR](https://no-color.org/) standard through the NO_COLOR environment variable. To disable color in console output 
add the NO_COLOR environment variable and assign it a non-empty value. This will disable color output on the console.

### Maps
Maps are automatically generated for regions and rooms, and can be viewed with the **map** command:

![map](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ebbc0925-7252-41d0-9c2d-60e89ecebd1c)

Maps display visited rooms, exits, player position, if an item is in a room, lower floors and more. Maps support panning and switching between vertical levels.

### Persistence
Game state can be serialized allowing progress to be saved to file and restored later.

### Targets
NetAF natively targets console, web and markup which allows other targets to be added as needed. Included in the repo are Console, WPF and Blazor examples.

For more information about targeting different project types visit the [NetAF.WPF](https://github.com/benpollarduk/NetAF.WPF) and [NetAF.Blazor](https://github.com/benpollarduk/NetAF.Blazor) repos.

## Getting Started

### Clone the repo/pull NuGet
Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/benpollarduk/netaf.git
```
Or add the NuGet package:
```bash
dotnet add package NetAF
```

### Hello World
```csharp
// create the player. this is the character the user plays as
var player = new PlayableCharacter("Dave", "A young boy on a quest to find the meaning of life.");

// create region maker. the region maker simplifies creating in game regions. a region contains a series of rooms
var regionMaker = new RegionMaker("Mountain", "An imposing volcano just East of town.")
{
    // add a room to the region at position x 0, y 0, z 0
    [0, 0, 0] = new Room("Cavern", "A dark cavern set in to the base of the mountain.")
};

// create overworld maker. the overworld maker simplifies creating in game overworlds. an overworld contains a series or regions
var overworldMaker = new OverworldMaker("Daves World", "An ancient kingdom.", regionMaker);

// create the configuration for running the game. Size.Dynamic will size the game to the console.
// alternatively a fixed size can be specified and the console will size to the game
var configuration = new GameConfiguration(new ConsoleAdapter(), FrameBuilderCollections.Console, Size.Dynamic)

// create the callback for generating new instances of the game
// - information about the game
// - an introduction to the game, displayed at the star
// - asset generation for the overworld and the player
// - the conditions that end the game
// - the configuration for the game
var gameCreator = Game.Create(
    new GameInfo("The Life of Dave", "A very low budget adventure.", "Ben Pollard"),
    "Dave awakes to find himself in a cavern...",
    AssetGenerator.Retained(overworldMaker.Make(), player),
    GameEndConditions.NoEnd,
    configuration);

// begin the execution of the game
Game.Execute(gameCreator);
```

### Tutorial
The quickest way to start getting to grips with NetAF is to take a look at the [Getting Started](https://benpollarduk.github.io/NetAF-docs/docs/getting-started.html) page.

### Example game
An example game is provided in the [NetAF.Example](https://github.com/benpollarduk/adventure-framework/tree/main/NetAF.Example) directory 
and has been designed with the aim of showcasing the various features.

Set either the **NetAF.Example.Console**, **NetAF.Example.WPF** or **NetAF.Example.Blazor** projects as the start up project and then build and run to start the application.

## Projects
Below are some projects that use NetAF:

* [Trouble Aboard the SS Hammerhead](https://benpollarduk.github.io/SSHammerhead-docs/) - A text adventure written in NetAF. The source is available [here](https://github.com/benpollarduk/SSHammerhead). Although not optimised yet, *TASSHH* can be played in the [browser](https://benpollarduk.github.io/SSHammerhead/).
