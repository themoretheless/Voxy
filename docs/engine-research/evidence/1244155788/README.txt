StemStudio gives you a complete authoring environment — scene editor, behavior scripting in JavaScript, physics, multiplayer, an AI copilot — that runs entirely on your machine. Projects live in your browser (IndexedDB) or in a folder you pick (File System Access API). No accounts, no cloud, no lock-in.

## Sponsor this project

If StemStudio is useful to you or your organization, please consider sponsoring its continued development. Sponsorships fund maintenance, new features, documentation, and community support.

## Features

- **3D scene editor** built on Three.js — primitives, materials, transforms, scene tree, viewport, gizmos.
- **Behaviors** — JavaScript classes attached to scene objects with a lifecycle (`init`, `update`, `onCollision`, etc.) and a built-in pack covering input, character controllers, vehicles, AI NPCs, UI, audio, and more.
- **Lambdas** — an entity-component system on top of behaviors when you need archetype-driven, batched work.
- **In-editor code editor** — Monaco for behavior and script authoring with full TypeScript-style assist.
- **Physics** — Ammo.js / Rapier integration with rigid bodies, joints, raycasting.
- **Local multiplayer** — Colyseus sidecar auto-spawned on `bun run dev`. Two browser tabs on the same machine join a real room.
- **AI copilot (BYOK)** — bring your own keys for Anthropic, OpenAI, Meshy / Tripo / Rodin (3D model gen), ElevenLabs (TTS), and AnythingWorld. Configure once, use everywhere.
- **Local-first persistence** — IndexedDB for seamless auto-save, or open a real folder via File System Access API (Chromium) for git-friendly workflows.
- **Export & share** — package any project as a standalone static site (Player-only build) you can host anywhere.

## Quick start

Prerequisites: [Bun](https://bun.sh) 1.0+, [Go](https://go.dev) 1.21+, [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 20+. New machine? See [Setting up your dev environment](#setting-up-your-dev-environment) for per-OS install steps (macOS, Windows, Linux).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/stemstudio.git
cd stemstudio
git submodule update --init --recursive
bun install
bun run dev
```

That single command starts three processes:

- **Vite** on `http://localhost:5173` — the editor.
- **AI server** on `http://localhost:8081` — proxies AI calls to providers using your keys.
- **Multiplayer sidecar** on `ws://localhost:2567` — Colyseus rooms for local multiplayer.

Open `http://localhost:5173` and follow the first-time bootstrap modal to pick your project storage mode (IndexedDB or local folder).

To use AI features, add a `.env` file (copy from `.env.example`) with whichever provider keys you want:

```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
MESHY_API_KEY=...
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=...
ANYTHING_WORLD_API_KEY=...
```

Any key you omit makes that provider unavailable — the editor will prompt you for it when you first try a feature that needs it.

## Setting up your dev environment

You need three tools on your `PATH`: **[Bun](https://bun.sh) 1.0+** (package manager + task runner), **[Go](https://go.dev) 1.21+** (the AI proxy server), and **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 20+** with `npm` (the multiplayer sidecar). Pick your OS below, then continue with [Quick start](#quick-start).

### macOS

Using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):

```bash
brew install oven-sh/bun/bun go node git
```

Or install each from its official site (links above). Apple Silicon and Intel are both supported.

### Linux

```bash
# Bun
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash

# Node.js 20+ — via nvm (recommended; distro packages are often older)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.1/install.sh | bash
nvm install 20

# Go 1.21+ — prefer the official tarball; distro `golang-go` may lag
#   https://go.dev/doc/install   (or: sudo apt install golang-go / sudo dnf install golang)

# Build essentials for any native dependency compilation
sudo apt install -y build-essential git    # Debian/Ubuntu
# sudo dnf groupinstall "Development Tools"  # Fedora/RHEL
```

Open a new shell (or `source ~/.bashrc`) so the freshly installed tools land on your `PATH`.

### Windows

**Use [WSL2](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl/install) (recommended).** Several `package.json` scripts use Unix-shell idioms — inline env vars like `BUILD_MODE=oss …` and `.sh` deploy scripts — that do not run under native `cmd`/PowerShell. WSL2 gives you a real Linux shell where everything works as documented.

```powershell
wsl --install            # installs Ubuntu; reboot if prompted
```

Then open the **Ubuntu** terminal and follow the **Linux** instructions above. Clone the repo *inside* the WSL filesystem (e.g. `~/code/…`, not `/mnt/c/…`) for usable file-watch and build performance.

<details>
<summary>Native Windows (advanced, unsupported)</summary>

```powershell
winget install OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS GoLang.Go Git.Git
powershell -c "irm bun.sh/install.ps1 | iex"
```

You will still need to work around the Unix-style scripts (e.g. run the editor, AI server, and MP sidecar separately and set `BUILD_MODE` via `$env:BUILD_MODE`). WSL2 is strongly preferred.

</details>

### Verify

```bash
bun --version     # 1.0+
go version        # go1.21+
node --version    # v20+
```

If all three print a version, you're ready for [Quick start](#quick-start).

## What's in the box

- Editor, player, runtime, behaviors, lambdas, physics, rendering, scheduler, asset loading.
- Monaco-based script/behavior editor.
- Local multiplayer Colyseus sidecar.
- AI proxy server (Go) that forwards calls to your provider keys.
- BYOK key management — keys stay in your browser's IndexedDB and are only sent to the provider you configured.
- Build tooling (Vite, TypeScript, ESLint, Bun test).
- Engine docs alongside the code: behaviors, lambdas/ECS, physics, UI, art specs.

## Documentation

- [Architecture overview](./docs/architecture.md) — how the editor, AI server, and multiplayer sidecar fit together.
- [Scheduler & editor settings](./docs/scheduler-and-editor-settings.md) — frame scheduler architecture, quality presets, performance controls, and profiling tools.
- [Stem Script](./docs/stem-script.md) — the editor DSL, command-contract boundary, Script Tool mode, and `.stemscript` game imports.
- [Built-in behaviors](./docs/built-in-behaviors.md) — the behavior model, the full catalog, and how to attach or author one.
- [Lambdas (ECS layer)](./docs/lambdas.md) — batched, dependency-scheduled systems over many objects, with examples.
- [Import packs](./docs/import-packs.md) — curated reusable script modules (`noise`, `prng`, `uikit-dual-mode`) and the `@import` workflow.
- [BYOK setup](./docs/byok.md) — connect your AI provider keys.
- [Multiplayer guide](./docs/multiplayer.md) — local sidecar and self-hosted deployment.
- [Exporting a game](./docs/exporting-a-game.md) — package a Player-only static site.
- [Contributing](./CONTRIBUTING.md) — development workflow and PR guidelines.

Existing games in Stem Script format live in
[Stem-Studio/Games-StemScript](https://github.com/Stem-Studio/Games-StemScript).
Deeper engine docs (behaviors lifecycle, lambdas/ECS, physics, scheduler,
rendering) live under `docs/` in this repo.

## Development workflow

This project uses Bun as its package manager and task runner.

```bash
bun run dev            # All-in-one: Vite + AI server + MP sidecar
bun run dev:editor     # Editor only (Vite)
bun run dev:ai         # AI server only
bun run dev:mp         # MP sidecar only

bun run build          # Production static build
bun run typecheck      # TypeScript verification
bun run test           # Unit + integration tests
bun run lint           # ESLint
```

To export a single project as a Player-only static site, use the in-editor **File → Export game** action and follow the instructions in [docs/exporting-a-game.md](./docs/exporting-a-game.md).

## Browser support

- **Chromium-based** (Chrome, Edge, Brave, Arc): full feature set including File System Access API for folder-based project storage.
- **Firefox**: full feature set with IndexedDB storage only (no folder access).
- **Safari**: full feature set with IndexedDB storage only (no folder access).

WebGPU support is required. We do not support WebGL
