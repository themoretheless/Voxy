# shallot

webgpu game engine. fast by default, instant iteration, runs where webgpu does.

## quick start

```bash
# install bun
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash

# new project
bun create shallot my-game
cd my-game
bun install

# run it
bunx shallot dev
```

The project owns its `index.html` and Vite config, with `plugins: [shallot()]`.

Projects depend on Shallot through a registry release (including `@next` prereleases), a staged tarball or a live link; see [Dependencies and releases](CONTRIBUTING.md#dependencies-and-releases) for commands.

For web, `shallot dev`, `shallot build` and `shallot preview` run the project's Vite commands. Native `dev` and `build` add the desktop shell; native `preview` launches that build.

Use `bun test` for Bun checks and `bunx playwright test` for browser checks. `bunx shallot --help` lists every command.
